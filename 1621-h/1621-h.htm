    <h2>
      FIRST SCENE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      At Sea.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The night had come to an end. The new-born day waited for its quickening
      light in the silence that is never known on land&mdash;the silence before
      sunrise, in a calm at sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a breath came from the dead air. Not a ripple stirred on the
      motionless water. Nothing changed but the softly-growing light; nothing
      moved but the lazy mist, curling up to meet the sun, its master, on the
      eastward sea. By fine gradations, the airy veil of morning thinned in
      substance as it rose&mdash;thinned, till there dawned through it in the
      first rays of sunlight the tall white sails of a Schooner Yacht.
    </p>
    <p>
      From stem to stern silence possessed the vessel&mdash;as silence possessed
      the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one living creature was on deck&mdash;the man at the helm, dozing
      peaceably with his arm over the useless tiller. Minute by minute the light
      grew, and the heat grew with it; and still the helmsman slumbered, the
      heavy sails hung noiseless, the quiet water lay sleeping against the
      vessel&rsquo;s sides. The whole orb of the sun was visible above the water-line,
      when the first sound pierced its way through the morning silence. From far
      off over the shining white ocean, the cry of a sea-bird reached the yacht
      on a sudden out of the last airy circles of the waning mist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sleeper at the helm woke; looked up at the idle sails, and yawned in
      sympathy with them; looked out at the sea on either side of him, and shook
      his head obstinately at the superior obstinacy of the calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blow, my little breeze!&rdquo; said the man, whistling the sailor&rsquo;s invocation
      to the wind softly between his teeth. &ldquo;Blow, my little breeze!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s her head?&rdquo; cried a bold and brassy voice, hailing the deck from the
      cabin staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anywhere you like, master; all round the compass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice was followed by the man. The owner of the yacht appeared on
      deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behold Richard Turlington, Esq., of the great Levant firm of Pizzituti,
      Turlington &amp; Branca! Aged eight-and-thirty; standing stiffly and
      sturdily at a height of not more than five feet six&mdash;Mr. Turlington
      presented to the view of his fellow-creatures a face of the perpendicular
      order of human architecture. His forehead was a straight line, his upper
      lip was another, his chin was the straightest and the longest line of all.
      As he turned his swarthy countenance eastward, and shaded his light gray
      eyes from the sun, his knotty hand plainly revealed that it had got him
      his living by its own labor at one time or another in his life. Taken on
      the whole, this was a man whom it might be easy to respect, but whom it
      would be hard to love. Better company at the official desk than at the
      social table. Morally and physically&mdash;if the expression may be
      permitted&mdash;a man without a bend in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A calm yesterday,&rdquo; grumbled Richard Turlington, looking with stubborn
      deliberation all round him. &ldquo;And a calm to-day. Ha! next season I&rsquo;ll have
      the vessel fitted with engines. I hate this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of the filthy coals, and the infernal vibration, and leave your
      beautiful schooner as she is. We are out for a holiday. Let the wind and
      the sea take a holiday too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pronouncing those words of remonstrance, a slim, nimble, curly-headed
      young gentleman joined Richard Turlington on deck, with his clothes under
      his arm, his towels in his hand, and nothing on him but the night-gown in
      which he had stepped out of his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Launcelot Linzie, you have been received on board my vessel in the
      capacity of medical attendant on Miss Natalie Graybrooke, at her father&rsquo;s
      request. Keep your place, if you please. When I want your advice, I&rsquo;ll ask
      you for it.&rdquo; Answering in those terms, the elder man fixed his colorless
      gray eyes on the younger with an expression which added plainly, &ldquo;There
      won&rsquo;t be room enough in this schooner much longer for me and for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Launcelot Linzie had his reasons (apparently) for declining to let his
      host offend him on any terms whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; he rejoined, in a tone of satirical good humor. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t
      easy to keep my place on board your vessel. I can&rsquo;t help presuming to
      enjoy myself as if I was the owner. The life is such a new one&mdash;to <i>me!</i>
      It&rsquo;s so delightfully easy, for instance, to wash yourself here. On shore
      it&rsquo;s a complicated question of jugs and basins and tubs; one is always in
      danger of breaking something, or spoiling something. Here you have only to
      jump out of bed, to run up on deck, and to do this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned, and scampered to the bows of the vessel. In one instant he was
      out of his night-gown, in another he was on the bulwark, in a third he was
      gamboling luxuriously in sixty fathoms of salt-water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turlington&rsquo;s eyes followed him with a reluctant, uneasy attention as he
      swam round the vessel, the only moving object in view. Turlington&rsquo;s mind,
      steady and slow in all its operations, set him a problem to be solved, on
      given conditions, as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Launcelot Linzie is fifteen years younger than I am. Add to that,
      Launcelot Linzie is Natalie Graybrooke&rsquo;s cousin. Given those two
      advantages&mdash;Query: Has he taken Natalie&rsquo;s fancy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turning that question slowly over and over in his mind, Richard Turlington
      seated himself in a corner at the stern of the vessel. He was still at
      work on the problem, when the young surgeon returned to his cabin to put
      the finishing touches to his toilet. He had not reached the solution when
      the steward appeared an hour later and said, &ldquo;Breakfast is ready, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were a party of five round the cabin table.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, Sir Joseph Graybrooke. Inheritor of a handsome fortune made by his
      father and his grandfather in trade. Mayor, twice elected, of a thriving
      provincial town. Officially privileged, while holding that dignity, to
      hand a silver trowel to a royal personage condescending to lay a first
      stone of a charitable edifice. Knighted, accordingly, in honor of the
      occasion. Worthy of the honor and worthy of the occasion. A type of his
      eminently respectable class. Possessed of an amiable, rosy face, and soft,
      silky white hair. Sound in his principles; tidy in his dress; blessed with
      moderate politics and a good digestion&mdash;a harmless, healthy, spruce,
      speckless, weak-minded old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, Miss Lavinia Graybrooke, Sir Joseph&rsquo;s maiden sister. Personally,
      Sir Joseph in petticoats. If you knew one you knew the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly, Miss Natalie Graybrooke&mdash;Sir Joseph&rsquo;s only child.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had inherited the personal appearance and the temperament of her
      mother&mdash;dead many years since. There had been a mixture of Negro
      blood and French blood in the late Lady Graybrooke&rsquo;s family, settled
      originally in Martinique. Natalie had her mother&rsquo;s warm dusky color, her
      mother&rsquo;s superb black hair, and her mother&rsquo;s melting, lazy, lovely brown
      eyes. At fifteen years of age (dating from her last birthday) she
      possessed the development of the bosom and limbs which in England is
      rarely attained before twenty. Everything about the girl&mdash;except her
      little rosy ears&mdash;was on a grand Amazonian scale. Her shapely hand
      was long and large; her supple waist was the waist of a woman. The
      indolent grace of all her movements had its motive power in an almost
      masculine firmness of action and profusion of physical resource. This
      remarkable bodily development was far from being accompanied by any
      corresponding development of character. Natalie&rsquo;s manner was the gentle,
      innocent manner of a young girl. She had her father&rsquo;s sweet temper
      ingrafted on her mother&rsquo;s variable Southern nature. She moved like a
      goddess, and she laughed like a child. Signs of maturing too rapidly&mdash;of
      outgrowing her strength, as the phrase went&mdash;had made their
      appearance in Sir Joseph&rsquo;s daughter during the spring. The family doctor
      had suggested a sea-voyage, as a wise manner of employing the fine summer
      months. Richard Turlington&rsquo;s yacht was placed at her disposal, with
      Richard Turlington himself included as one of the fixtures of the vessel.
      With her father and her aunt to keep up round her the atmosphere of home&mdash;with
      Cousin Launcelot (more commonly known as &ldquo;Launce&rdquo;) to carry out, if
      necessary, the medical treatment prescribed by superior authority on shore&mdash;the
      lovely invalid embarked on her summer cruise, and sprang up into a new
      existence in the life-giving breezes of the sea. After two happy months of
      lazy coasting round the shores of England, all that remained of Natalie&rsquo;s
      illness was represented by a delicious languor in her eyes, and an utter
      inability to devote herself to anything which took the shape of a serious
      occupation. As she sat at the cabin breakfast-table that morning, in her
      quaintly-made sailing dress of old-fashioned nankeen&mdash;her inbred
      childishness of manner contrasting delightfully with the blooming maturity
      of her form&mdash;the man must have been trebly armed indeed in the modern
      philosophy who could have denied that the first of a woman&rsquo;s rights is the
      right of being beautiful; and the foremost of a woman&rsquo;s merits, the merit
      of being young!
    </p>
    <p>
      The other two persons present at the table were the two gentlemen who have
      already appeared on the deck of the yacht.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a breath of wind stirring!&rdquo; said Richard Turlington. &ldquo;The weather has
      got a grudge against us. We have drifted about four or five miles in the
      last eight-and-forty hours. You will never take another cruise with me&mdash;you
      must be longing to get on shore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He addressed himself to Natalie; plainly eager to make himself agreeable
      to the young lady&mdash;and plainly unsuccessful in producing any
      impression on her. She made a civil answer; and looked at her tea-cup,
      instead of looking at Richard Turlington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might fancy yourself on shore at this moment,&rdquo; said Launce. &ldquo;The
      vessel is as steady as a house, and the swing-table we are eating our
      breakfast on is as even as your dining-room table at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He too addressed himself to Natalie, but without betraying the anxiety to
      please her which had been shown by the other. For all that, <i>he</i>
      diverted the girl&rsquo;s attention from her tea-cup; and <i>his</i> idea
      instantly awakened a responsive idea in Natalie&rsquo;s mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be so strange on shore,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to find myself in a room that
      never turns on one side, and to sit at a table that never tilts down to my
      knees at one time, or rises up to my chin at another. How I shall miss the
      wash of the water at my ear, and the ring of the bell on deck when I am
      awake at night on land! No interest there in how the wind blows, or how
      the sails are set. No asking your way of the sun, when you are lost, with
      a little brass instrument and a morsel of pencil and paper. No delightful
      wandering wherever the wind takes you, without the worry of planning
      beforehand where you are to go. Oh how I shall miss the dear, changeable,
      inconstant sea! And how sorry I am I&rsquo;m not a man and a sailor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This to the guest admitted on board on sufferance, and not one word of it
      addressed, even by chance, to the owner of the yacht!
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard Turlington&rsquo;s heavy eyebrows contracted with an unmistakable
      expression of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this calm weather holds,&rdquo; he went on, addressing himself to Sir
      Joseph, &ldquo;I am afraid, Graybrooke, I shall not be able to bring you back to
      the port we sailed from by the end of the week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever you like, Richard,&rdquo; answered the old gentleman, resignedly. &ldquo;Any
      time will do for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any time within reasonable limits, Joseph,&rdquo; said Miss Lavinia, evidently
      feeling that her brother was conceding too much. She spoke with Sir
      Joseph&rsquo;s amiable smile and Sir Joseph&rsquo;s softly-pitched voice. Two twin
      babies could hardly have been more like one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these few words were being exchanged among the elders, a private
      communication was in course of progress between the two young people under
      the cabin table. Natalie&rsquo;s smartly-slippered foot felt its way cautiously
      inch by inch over the carpet till it touched Launce&rsquo;s boot. Launce,
      devouring his breakfast, instantly looked up from his plate, and then, at
      a second touch from Natalie, looked down again in a violent hurry. After
      pausing to make sure that she was not noticed, Natalie took up her knife.
      Under a perfectly-acted pretense of toying with it absently, in the
      character of a young lady absorbed in thought, she began dividing a morsel
      of ham left on the edge of her plate, into six tiny pieces. Launce&rsquo;s eye
      looked in sidelong expectation at the divided and subdivided ham. He was
      evidently waiting to see the collection of morsels put to some telegraphic
      use, previously determined on between his neighbor and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile the talk proceeded among the other persons at the
      breakfast-table. Miss Lavinia addressed herself to Launce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, you careless boy, you gave me a fright this morning? I was
      sleeping with my cabin window open, and I was awoke by an awful splash in
      the water. I called for the stewardess. I declare I thought somebody had
      fallen overboard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Joseph looked up briskly; his sister had accidentally touched on an
      old association.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk of falling overboard,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;reminds me of an extraordinary
      adventure&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There Launce broke in, making his apologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shan&rsquo;t occur again, Miss Lavinia,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;To-morrow morning I&rsquo;ll
      oil myself all over, and slip into the water as silently as a seal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of an extraordinary adventure,&rdquo; persisted Sir Joseph, &ldquo;which happened to
      me many years ago, when I was a young man. Lavinia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, and looked interrogatively at his sister. Miss Graybrooke
      nodded her head responsively, and settled herself in her chair, as if
      summoning her attention in anticipation of a coming demand on it. To
      persons well acquainted with the brother and sister these proceedings were
      ominous of an impending narrative, protracted to a formidable length. The
      two always told a story in couples, and always differed with each other
      about the facts, the sister politely contradicting the brother when it was
      Sir Joseph&rsquo;s story, and the brother politely contradicting the sister when
      it was Miss Lavinia&rsquo;s story. Separated one from the other, and thus
      relieved of their own habitual interchange of contradiction, neither of
      them had ever been known to attempt the relation of the simplest series of
      events without breaking down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was five years before I knew you, Richard,&rdquo; proceeded Sir Joseph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six years,&rdquo; said Miss Graybrooke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, Lavinia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Joseph, I have it down in my diary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us waive the point.&rdquo; (Sir Joseph invariably used this formula as a
      means of at once conciliating his sister, and getting a fresh start for
      his story.) &ldquo;I was cruising off the Mersey in a Liverpool pilot-boat. I
      had hired the boat in company with a friend of mine, formerly notorious in
      London society, under the nickname (derived from the peculiar brown color
      of his whiskers) of &lsquo;Mahogany Dobbs.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The color of his liveries, Joseph, not the color of his whiskers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Lavinia, you are thinking of &lsquo;Sea-green Shaw,&rsquo; so called from the
      extraordinary liveries he adopted for his servants in the year when he was
      sheriff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not, Joseph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Lavinia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard Turlington&rsquo;s knotty fingers drummed impatiently on the table. He
      looked toward Natalie. She was idly arranging her little morsels of ham in
      a pattern on her plate. Launcelot Linzie, still more idly, was looking at
      the pattern. Seeing what he saw now, Richard solved the problem which had
      puzzled him on deck. It was simply impossible that Natalie&rsquo;s fancy could
      be really taken by such an empty-headed fool as that!
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Joseph went on with his story:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were some ten or a dozen miles off the mouth of the Mersey&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nautical miles, Joseph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter, Lavinia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, brother, the late great and good Doctor Johnson said accuracy
      ought always to be studied even in the most trifling things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were common miles, Lavinia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were nautical miles, Joseph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us waive the point. Mahogany Dobbs and I happened to be below in the
      cabin, occupied&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Sir Joseph paused (with his amiable smile) to consult his memory.
      Miss Lavinia waited (with <i>her</i> amiable smile) for the coming
      opportunity of setting her brother right. At the same moment Natalie laid
      down her knife and softly touched Launce under the table. When she thus
      claimed his attention the six pieces of ham were arranged as follows in
      her plate: Two pieces were placed opposite each other, and four pieces
      were ranged perpendicularly under them. Launce looked, and twice touched
      Natalie under the table. Interpreted by the Code agreed on between the
      two, the signal in the plate meant, &ldquo;I must see you in private.&rdquo; And
      Launce&rsquo;s double touch answered, &ldquo;After breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Joseph proceeded with his story. Natalie took up her knife again.
      Another signal coming!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were both down in the cabin, occupied in finishing our dinner&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just sitting down to lunch, Joseph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear! I ought to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only repeat what I heard, brother. The last time you told the story,
      you and your friend were sitting down to lunch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t particularize, Lavinia. Suppose we say occupied over a meal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is of no more importance than that, Joseph, it would be surely
      better to leave it out altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us waive the point. Well, we were suddenly alarmed by a shout on
      deck, &lsquo;Man over-board!&rsquo; We both rushed up the cabin stairs, naturally
      under the impression that one of our crew had fallen into the sea: an
      impression shared, I ought to add, by the man at the helm, who had given
      the alarm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Joseph paused again. He was approaching one of the great dramatic
      points in his story, and was naturally anxious to present it as
      impressively as possible. He considered with himself, with his head a
      little on one side. Miss Lavinia considered with <i>herself</i>, with <i>her</i>
      head a little on one side. Natalie laid down her knife again, and again
      touched Launce under the table. This time there were five pieces of ham
      ranged longitudinally on the plate, with one piece immediately under them
      at the center of the line. Interpreted by the Code, this signal indicated
      two ominous words, &ldquo;Bad news.&rdquo; Launce looked significantly at the owner of
      the yacht (meaning of the look, &ldquo;Is he at the bottom of it?&rdquo;). Natalie
      frowned in reply (meaning of the frown, &ldquo;Yes, he is&rdquo;). Launce looked down
      again into the plate. Natalie instantly pushed all the pieces of ham
      together in a little heap (meaning of the heap, &ldquo;No more to say&rdquo;).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Richard Turlington, turning sharply on Sir Joseph. &ldquo;Get on
      with your story. What next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus far he had not troubled himself to show even a decent pretense of
      interest in his old friend&rsquo;s perpetually-interrupted narrative. It was
      only when Sir Joseph had reached his last sentence&mdash;intimating that
      the man overboard might turn out in course of time not to be a man of the
      pilot-boat&rsquo;s crew&mdash;it was only then that Turlington sat up in his
      chair, and showed signs of suddenly feeling a strong interest in the
      progress of the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Joseph went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as we got on deck, we saw the man in the water, astern. Our
      vessel was hove up in the wind, and the boat was lowered. The master and
      one of the men took the oars. All told, our crew were seven in number. Two
      away in the boat, a third at the helm, and, to my amazement, when I looked
      round, the other four behind me making our number complete. At the same
      moment Mahogany Dobbs, who was looking through a telescope, called out,
      &lsquo;Who the devil can he be? The man is floating on a hen-coop, and we have
      got nothing of the sort on board this pilot-boat.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The one person present who happened to notice Richard Turlington&rsquo;s face
      when those words were pronounced was Launcelot Linzie. He&mdash;and he
      alone&mdash;saw the Levant trader&rsquo;s swarthy complexion fade slowly to a
      livid ashen gray; his eyes the while fixing themselves on Sir Joseph
      Graybrooke with a furtive glare in them like the glare in the eyes of a
      wild beast. Apparently conscious that Launce was looking at him&mdash;though
      he never turned his head Launce&rsquo;s way&mdash;he laid his elbow on the
      table, lifted his arm, and so rested his face on his hand, while the story
      went on, as to screen it effectually from the young surgeon&rsquo;s view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man was brought on board,&rdquo; proceeded Sir Joseph, &ldquo;sure enough, with a
      hen-coop&mdash;on which he had been found floating. The poor wretch was
      blue with terror and exposure in the water; he fainted when we lifted him
      on deck. When he came to himself he told us a horrible story. He was a
      sick and destitute foreign seaman, and he had hidden himself in the hold
      of an English vessel (bound to a port in his native country) which had
      sailed from Liverpool that morning. He had been discovered, and brought
      before the captain. The captain, a monster in human form, if ever there
      was one yet&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before the next word of the sentence could pass Sir Joseph&rsquo;s lips,
      Turlington startled the little party in the cabin by springing suddenly to
      his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The breeze!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;the breeze at last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, he wheeled round to the cabin door so as to turn his back on
      his guests, and hailed the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which way is the wind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not a breath of wind, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not the slightest movement in the vessel had been perceptible in the
      cabin; not a sound had been audible indicating the rising of the breeze.
      The owner of the yacht&mdash;accustomed to the sea, capable, if necessary,
      of sailing his own vessel&mdash;had surely committed a strange mistake! He
      turned again to his friends, and made his apologies with an excess of
      polite regret far from characteristic of him at other times and under
      other circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he said to Sir Joseph, when he had got to the end of his excuses;
      &ldquo;I never heard such an interesting story in my life. Pray go on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The request was not an easy one to comply with. Sir Joseph&rsquo;s ideas had
      been thrown into confusion. Miss Lavinia&rsquo;s contradictions (held in
      reserve) had been scattered beyond recall. Both brother and sister were,
      moreover, additionally hindered in recovering the control of their own
      resources by the look and manner of their host. He alarmed, instead of
      encouraging the two harmless old people, by fronting them almost fiercely,
      with his elbows squared on the table, and his face expressive of a dogged
      resolution to sit there and listen, if need be, for the rest of his life.
      Launce was the person who set Sir Joseph going again. After first looking
      attentively at Richard, he took his uncle straight back to the story by
      means of a question, thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say that the captain of the ship threw the man
      overboard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just what he did, Launce. The poor wretch was too ill to work his
      passage. The captain declared he would have no idle foreign vagabond in
      his ship to eat up the provisions of Englishmen who worked. With his own
      hands he cast the hen-coop into the water, and (assisted by one of his
      sailors) he threw the man after it, and told him to float back to
      Liverpool with the evening tide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lie!&rdquo; cried Turlington, addressing himself, not to Sir Joseph, but to
      Launce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you acquainted with the circumstances?&rdquo; asked Launce, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about the circumstances. I say, from my own experience,
      that foreign sailors are even greater blackguards than English sailors.
      The man had met with an accident, no doubt. The rest of his story was a
      lie, and the object of it was to open Sir Joseph&rsquo;s purse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Joseph mildly shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No lie, Richard. Witnesses proved that the man had spoken the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Witnesses? Pooh! More liars, you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went to the owners of the vessel,&rdquo; pursued Sir Joseph. &ldquo;I got from them
      the names of the officers and the crew, and I waited, leaving the case in
      the hands of the Liverpool police. The ship was wrecked at the mouth of
      the Amazon, but the crew and the cargo were saved. The men belonging to
      Liverpool came back. They were a bad set, I grant you. But they were
      examined separately about the treatment of the foreign sailor, and they
      all told the same story. They could give no account of their captain, nor
      of the sailor who had been his accomplice in the crime, except that they
      had not embarked in the ship which brought the rest of the crew to
      England. Whatever may have become of the captain since, he certainly never
      returned to Liverpool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you find out his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question was asked by Turlington. Even Sir Joseph, the least observant
      of men, noticed that it was put with a perfectly unaccountable
      irritability of manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry, Richard.&rdquo; said the old gentleman. &ldquo;What is there to be
      angry about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean. I&rsquo;m not angry&mdash;I&rsquo;m only curious. <i>Did</i>
      you find out who he was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did. His name was Goward. He was well known at Liverpool as a very
      clever and a very dangerous man. Quite young at the time I am speaking of,
      and a first-rate sailor; famous for taking command of unseaworthy ships
      and vagabond crews. Report described him to me as having made considerable
      sums of money in that way, for a man in his position; serving firms, you
      know, with a bad name, and running all sorts of desperate risks. A sad
      ruffian, Richard! More than once in trouble, on both sides of the
      Atlantic, for acts of violence and cruelty. Dead, I dare say, long since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or possibly,&rdquo; said Launce, &ldquo;alive, under another name, and thriving in a
      new way of life, with more desperate risks in it, of some other sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are <i>you</i> acquainted with the circumstances?&rdquo; asked Turlington,
      retorting Launce&rsquo;s question on him, with a harsh ring of defiance in his
      brassy voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What became of the poor foreign sailor, papa?&rdquo; said Natalie, purposely
      interrupting Launce before he could meet the question angrily asked of
      him, by an angry reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We made a subscription, and spoke to his consul, my dear. He went back to
      his country, poor fellow, comfortably enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there is an end of Sir Joseph&rsquo;s story,&rdquo; said Turlington, rising
      noisily from his chair. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity we haven&rsquo;t got a literary man on
      board&mdash;he would make a novel of it.&rdquo; He looked up at the skylight as
      he got on his feet. &ldquo;Here is the breeze, this time,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;and no
      mistake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was true. At last the breeze had come. The sails flapped, the main boom
      swung over with a thump, and the stagnant water, stirred at last, bubbled
      merrily past the vessel&rsquo;s sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on deck, Natalie, and get some fresh air,&rdquo; said Miss Lavinia,
      leading the way to the cabin door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Natalie held up the skirt of her nankeen dress, and exhibited the purple
      trimming torn away over an extent of some yards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me half an hour first, aunt, in my cabin,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to mend this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lavinia elevated her venerable eyebrows in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done nothing but tear your dresses, my dear, since you have been
      in Mr. Turlington&rsquo;s yacht. Most extraordinary! I have torn none of mine
      during the whole cruise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Natalie&rsquo;s dark color deepened a shade. She laughed, a little uneasily. &ldquo;I
      am so awkward on board ship,&rdquo; she replied, and turned away and shut
      herself up in her cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard Turlington produced his case of cigars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now is the time,&rdquo; he said to Sir Joseph, &ldquo;for the best cigar of the day&mdash;the
      cigar after breakfast. Come on deck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will join us, Launce?&rdquo; said Sir Joseph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me half an hour first over my books,&rdquo; Launce replied. &ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t let
      my medical knowledge get musty at sea, and I might not feel inclined to
      study later in the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right, my dear boy, quite right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Joseph patted his nephew approvingly on the shoulder. Launce turned
      away on <i>his</i> side, and shut himself up in his cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other three ascended together to the deck.

    <h2>
      SECOND SCENE.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The Store-Room.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Persons possessed of sluggish livers and tender hearts find two serious
      drawbacks to the enjoyment of a cruise at sea. It is exceedingly difficult
      to get enough walking exercise; and it is next to impossible (where
      secrecy is an object) to make love without being found out. Reverting for
      the moment to the latter difficulty only, life within the narrow and
      populous limits of a vessel may be defined as essentially life in public.
      From morning to night you are in your neighbor&rsquo;s way, or your neighbor is
      in your way. As a necessary result of these conditions, the rarest of
      existing men may be defined as the man who is capable of stealing a kiss
      at sea without discovery. An inbred capacity for stratagem of the finest
      sort; inexhaustible inventive resources; patience which can flourish under
      superhuman trials; presence of mind which can keep its balance
      victoriously under every possible stress of emergency&mdash;these are some
      of the qualifications which must accompany Love on a cruise, when Love
      embarks in the character of a contraband commodity not duly entered on the
      papers of the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having established a Code of Signals which enabled them to communicate
      privately, while the eyes and ears of others were wide open on every side
      of them, Natalie and Launce were next confronted by the more serious
      difficulty of finding a means of meeting together at stolen interviews on
      board the yacht. Possessing none of those precious moral qualifications
      already enumerated as the qualifications of an accomplished lover at sea,
      Launce had proved unequal to grapple with the obstacles in his way. Left
      to her own inventive resources, Natalie had first suggested the young
      surgeon&rsquo;s medical studies as Launce&rsquo;s unanswerable excuse for shutting
      himself up at intervals in the lower regions, and had then hit on the
      happy idea of tearing her trimmings, and condemning herself to repair her
      own carelessness, as the all-sufficient reason for similar acts of
      self-seclusion on her side. In this way the lovers contrived, while the
      innocent ruling authorities were on deck, to meet privately below them, on
      the neutral ground of the main cabin; and there, by previous arrangement
      at the breakfast-table, they were about to meet privately now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Natalie&rsquo;s door was, as usual on these occasions, the first that opened;
      for this sound reason, that Natalie&rsquo;s quickness was the quickness to be
      depended on in case of accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at the sky-light. There were the legs of the two gentlemen
      and the skirts of her aunt visible (and stationary) on the lee side of the
      deck. She advanced a few steps and listened. There was a pause in the
      murmur of the voices above. She looked up again. One pair of legs (not her
      father&rsquo;s) had disappeared. Without an instant&rsquo;s hesitation, Natalie darted
      back to her own door, just in time to escape Richard Turlington descending
      the cabin stairs. All he did was to go to one of the drawers under the
      main-cabin book-case and to take out a map, ascending again immediately to
      the deck. Natalie&rsquo;s guilty conscience rushed instantly, nevertheless, to
      the conclusion that Richard suspected her. When she showed herself for the
      second time, instead of venturing into the cabin, she called across it in
      a whisper,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Launce!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Launce appeared at his door. He was peremptorily checked before he could
      cross the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stir a step! Richard has been down in the cabin! Richard suspects
      us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! Come out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing will induce me, unless you can find some other place than the
      cabin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some other place? How easy to find it on land! How apparently impossible
      at sea! There was the forecastle (full of men) at one end of the vessel.
      There was the sail room (full of sails) at the other. There was the
      ladies&rsquo; cabin (used as the ladies&rsquo; dressing-room; inaccessible, in that
      capacity, to every male human being on board). Was there any disposable
      inclosed space to be found amidships? On one side there were the sleeping
      berths of the sailing-master and his mate (impossible to borrow <i>them</i>).
      On the other side was the steward&rsquo;s store-room. Launce considered for a
      moment. The steward&rsquo;s store-room was just the thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; asked Natalie, as her lover made straight for a
      closed door at the lower extremity of the main cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To speak to the steward, darling. Wait one moment, and you will see me
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Launce opened the store-room door, and discovered, not the steward, but
      his wife, who occupied the situation of stewardess on board the vessel.
      The accident was, in this case, a lucky one. Having stolen several kisses
      at sea, and having been discovered (in every case) either by the steward
      or his wife, Launce felt no difficulty in prefacing his request to be
      allowed the use of the room by the plainest allusion to his relations with
      Natalie. He could count on the silence of the sympathizing authorities in
      this region of the vessel, having wisely secured them as accomplices by
      the usual persuasion of the pecuniary sort. Of the two, however, the
      stewardess, as a woman, was the more likely to lend a ready ear to
      Launce&rsquo;s entreaties in his present emergency. After a faint show of
      resistance, she consented, not only to leave the room, but to keep her
      husband out of it, on the understanding that it was not to be occupied for
      more than ten minutes. Launce made the signal to Natalie at one door,
      while the stewardess went out by the other. In a moment more the lovers
      were united in a private room. Is it necessary to say in what language the
      proceedings were opened? Surely not! There is an inarticulate language of
      the lips in use on these occasions in which we are all proficient, though
      we sometimes forget it in later life. Natalie seated herself on a locker.
      The tea, sugar, and spices were at her back, a side of bacon swung over
      her head, and a net full of lemons dangled before her face. It might not
      be roomy, but it was snug and comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose they call for the steward?&rdquo; she suggested. (&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Launce!&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind. We shall be safe enough if they do. The steward has only to
      show himself on deck, and they will suspect nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do be quiet, Launce! I have got dreadful news to tell you. And, besides,
      my aunt will expect to see me with my braid sewn on again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had brought her needle and thread with her. Whipping up the skirt of
      her dress on her knee, she bent forward over it, and set herself
      industriously to the repair of the torn trimming. In this position her
      lithe figure showed charmingly its firm yet easy line. The needle, in her
      dexterous brown fingers, flew through its work. The locker was a broad
      one; Launce was able to seat himself partially behind her. In this
      position who could have resisted the temptation to lift up her great knot
      of broadly-plaited black hair, and to let the warm, dusky nape of her neck
      disclose itself to view? Who, looking at it, could fail to revile the
      senseless modern fashion of dressing the hair, which hides the double
      beauty of form and color that nestles at the back of a woman&rsquo;s neck? From
      time to time, as the interview proceeded, Launce&rsquo;s lips emphasized the
      more important words occurring in his share of the conversation on the
      soft, fragrant skin which the lifted hair let him see at intervals. In
      Launce&rsquo;s place, sir, you would have done it too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Natalie, what is the news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has spoken to papa, Launce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard Turlington?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&mdash;n him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Natalie started. A curse addressed to the back of your neck, instantly
      followed by a blessing in the shape of a kiss, is a little trying when you
      are not prepared for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that again, Launce! It was while you were on deck smoking, and
      when I was supposed to be fast asleep. I opened the ventilator in my cabin
      door, dear, and I heard every word they said. He waited till my aunt was
      out of the way, and he had got papa all to himself, and then he began it
      in that horrible, downright voice of his&mdash;&lsquo;Graybrooke! how much
      longer am I to wait?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he say that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more swearing, Launce! Those were the words. Papa didn&rsquo;t understand
      them. He only said (poor dear!)&mdash;&lsquo;Bless my soul, Richard, what do you
      want?&rsquo; Richard soon explained himself. &lsquo;Who could he be waiting for&mdash;but
      Me?&rsquo; Papa said something about my being so young. Richard stopped his
      mouth directly. &lsquo;Girls were like fruit; some ripened soon, and some
      ripened late. Some were women at twenty, and some were women at sixteen.
      It was impossible to look at me, and not see that I was like a new being
      after my two months at sea,&rsquo; and so on and so on. Papa behaved like an
      angel. He still tried to put it off. &lsquo;Plenty of time, Richard, plenty of
      time.&rsquo; &lsquo;Plenty of time for <i>her</i>&rsquo; (was the wretch&rsquo;s answer to that);
      &lsquo;but not for <i>me</i>. Think of all I have to offer her&rsquo; (as if I cared
      for his money!); &lsquo;think how long I have looked upon her as growing up to
      be my wife&rsquo; (growing up for <i>him</i>&mdash;monstrous!), &lsquo;and don&rsquo;t keep
      me in a state of uncertainty, which it gets harder and harder for a man in
      my position to endure!&rsquo; He was really quite eloquent. His voice trembled.
      There is no doubt, dear, that he is very, very fond of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you feel flattered by it, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense. I feel a little frightened at it, I can tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frightened? Did <i>you</i> notice him this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When your father was telling that story about the man overboard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. What did he do? Tell me, Launce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you directly. How did it all end last night? Did your father
      make any sort of promise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know Richard&rsquo;s way; Richard left him no other choice. Papa had to
      promise before he was allowed to go to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To let Turlington marry you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; the week after my next birthday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The week after next Christmas-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Papa is to speak to me as soon as we are at home again, and my
      married life is to begin with the New Year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you in earnest, Natalie? Do you really mean to say it has gone as far
      as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have settled everything. The splendid establishment we are to set
      up, the great income we are to have. I heard papa tell Richard that half
      his fortune should go to me on my wedding-day. It was sickening to hear
      how much they made of Money, and how little they thought of Love. What am
      I to do, Launce?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s easily answered, my darling. In the first place, you are to make
      up your mind not to marry Richard Turlington&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do talk reasonably. You know I have done all I could. I have told papa
      that I can think of Richard as a friend, but not as a husband. He only
      laughs at me, and says, &lsquo;Wait a little, and you will alter your opinion,
      my dear.&rsquo; You see Richard is everything to him; Richard has always managed
      his affairs, and has saved him from losing by bad speculations; Richard
      has known me from the time when I was a child; Richard has a splendid
      business, and quantities of money. Papa can&rsquo;t even imagine that I can
      resist Richard. I have tried my aunt; I have told her he is too old for
      me. All she says is, &lsquo;Look at your father; he was much older than your
      mother, and what a happy marriage theirs was.&rsquo; Even if I said in so many
      words, &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t marry Richard,&rsquo; what good would it do to us? Papa is the
      best and dearest old man in the world; but oh, he is so fond of money! He
      believes in nothing else. He would be furious&mdash;yes, kind as he is, he
      would be furious&mdash;if I even hinted that I was fond of <i>you</i>. Any
      man who proposed to marry me&mdash;if he couldn&rsquo;t match the fortune that I
      should bring him by a fortune of his own&mdash;would be a lunatic in
      papa&rsquo;s eyes. He wouldn&rsquo;t think it necessary to answer him; he would ring
      the bell, and have him shown out of the house. I am exaggerating nothing,
      Launce; you know I am speaking the truth. There is no hope in the future&mdash;that
      I can see&mdash;for either of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you done, Natalie? I have something to say on my side if you have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If things go on as they are going on now, shall I tell you how it will
      end? It will end in your being Turlington&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you say now; but you don&rsquo;t know what may happen between this and
      Christmas-day. Natalie, there is only one way of making sure that you will
      never marry Richard. Marry <i>me</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without papa&rsquo;s consent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without saying a word to anybody till it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Launce! Launce!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling, every word you have said proves there is no other way. Think
      of it, Natalie, think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. Natalie dropped her needle and thread, and hid her face
      in her hands. &ldquo;If my poor mother was only alive,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;if I only had
      an elder sister to advise me, and to take my part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was evidently hesitating. Launce took a man&rsquo;s advantage of her
      indecision. He pressed her without mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you love me?&rdquo; he whispered, with his lips close to her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I do, dearly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put it out of Richard&rsquo;s power to part us, Natalie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Part us? We are cousins: we have known each other since we were both
      children. Even if he proposed parting us, papa wouldn&rsquo;t allow it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mark my words, he <i>will</i> propose it. As for your father, Richard has
      only to lift his finger and your father obeys him. My love, the happiness
      of both our lives is at stake.&rdquo; He wound his arm round her, and gently
      drew her head back on his bosom, &ldquo;Other girls have done it, darling,&rdquo; he
      pleaded, &ldquo;why shouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The effort to answer him was too much for her. She gave it up. A low sigh
      fluttered through her lips. She nestled closer to him, and faintly closed
      her eyes. The next instant she started up, trembling from head to foot,
      and looked at the sky-light. Richard Turlington&rsquo;s voice was suddenly
      audible on deck exactly above them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Graybrooke, I want to say a word to you about Launcelot Linzie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Natalie&rsquo;s first impulse was to fly to the door. Hearing Launce&rsquo;s name on
      Richard&rsquo;s lips, she checked herself. Something in Richard&rsquo;s tone roused in
      her the curiosity which suspends fear. She waited, with her hand in
      Launce&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you remember,&rdquo; the brassy voice went on, &ldquo;I doubted the wisdom of
      taking him with us on this cruise. You didn&rsquo;t agree with me, and, at your
      express request, I gave way. I did wrong. Launcelot Linzie is a very
      presuming young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Joseph&rsquo;s answer was accompanied by Sir Joseph&rsquo;s mellow laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Richard! Surely you are a little hard on Launce?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not an observant man, Graybrooke. I am. I see signs of his
      presuming with all of us, and especially with Natalie. I don&rsquo;t like the
      manner in which he speaks to her and looks at her. He is unduly familiar;
      he is insolently confidential. There must be a stop put to it. In my
      position, my feelings ought to be regarded. I request you to check the
      intimacy when we get on shore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Joseph&rsquo;s next words were spoken more seriously. He expressed his
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Richard, they are cousins, they have been playmates from
      childhood. How <i>can</i> you think of attaching the slightest importance
      to anything that is said or done by poor Launce?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a good-humored contempt in Sir Joseph&rsquo;s reference to &ldquo;poor
      Launce&rdquo; which jarred on his daughter. He might almost have been alluding
      to some harmless domestic animal. Natalie&rsquo;s color deepened. Her hand
      pressed Launce&rsquo;s hand gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turlington still persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must once more request&mdash;seriously request&mdash;that you will
      check this growing intimacy. I don&rsquo;t object to your asking him to the
      house when you ask other friends. I only wish you (and expect you) to stop
      his &lsquo;dropping in,&rsquo; as it is called, any hour of the day or evening when he
      may have nothing to do. Is that understood between us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you make a point of it, Richard, of course it&rsquo;s understood between
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Launce looked at Natalie, as weak Sir Joseph consented in those words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Natalie hung her head in silence. There was a pause in the conversation on
      deck. The two gentlemen walked away slowly toward the forward part of the
      vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Launce pursued his advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father leaves us no alternative,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The door will be closed
      against me as soon as we get on shore. If I lose you, Natalie, I don&rsquo;t
      care what becomes of me. My profession may go to the devil. I have nothing
      left worth living for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! hush! don&rsquo;t talk in that way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Launce tried the soothing influence of persuasion once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hundreds and hundreds of people in our situation have married privately&mdash;and
      have been forgiven afterward,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t ask you to do anything
      in a hurry. I will be guided entirely by your wishes. All I want to quiet
      my mind is to know that you are mine. Do, do, do make me feel sure that
      Richard Turlington can&rsquo;t take you away from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t press me, Launce.&rdquo; She dropped on the locker. &ldquo;See!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It
      makes me tremble only to think of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you afraid of, darling? Not your father, surely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor papa! I wonder whether he would be hard on me for the first time in
      his life?&rdquo; She stopped; her moistening eyes looked up imploringly in
      Launce&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t press me!&rdquo; she repeated faintly. &ldquo;You know it&rsquo;s
      wrong. We should have to confess it&mdash;and then what would happen?&rdquo; She
      paused again. Her eyes wandered nervously to the deck. Her voice dropped
      to its lowest tones. &ldquo;Think of Richard!&rdquo; she said, and shuddered at the
      terrors which that name conjured up. Before it was possible to say a
      quieting word to her, she was again on her feet. Richard&rsquo;s name had
      suddenly recalled to her memory Launce&rsquo;s mysterious allusion, at the
      outset of the interview, to the owner of the yacht. &ldquo;What was that you
      said about Richard just now?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;You saw something (or heard
      something) strange while papa was telling his story. What was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I noticed Richard&rsquo;s face, Natalie, when your father told us that the man
      overboard was not one of the pilot-boat&rsquo;s crew. He turned ghastly pale. He
      looked guilty&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guilty? Of what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was present&mdash;I am certain of it&mdash;when the sailor was thrown
      into the sea. For all I know, he may have been the man who did it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Natalie started back in horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Launce! Launce! that is too bad. You may not like Richard&mdash;you
      may treat Richard as your enemy. But to say such a horrible thing of him
      as that&mdash;It&rsquo;s not generous. It&rsquo;s not like <i>you</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had seen him, you would have said it too. I mean to make inquiries&mdash;in
      your father&rsquo;s interests as well as in ours. My brother knows one of the
      Commissioners of Police, and my brother can get it done for me. Turlington
      has not always been in the Levant trade&mdash;I know that already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For shame, Launce! for shame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The footsteps on deck were audible coming back. Natalie sprang to the door
      leading into the cabin. Launce stopped her, as she laid her hand on the
      lock. The footsteps went straight on toward the stern of the vessel.
      Launce clasped both arms round her. Natalie gave way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t drive me to despair!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is my last opportunity. I
      don&rsquo;t ask you to say at once that you will marry me, I only ask you to
      think of it. My darling! my angel! will you think of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he put the question, they might have heard (if they had not been too
      completely engrossed in each other to listen) the footsteps returning&mdash;one
      pair of footsteps only this time. Natalie&rsquo;s prolonged absence had begun to
      surprise her aunt, and had roused a certain vague distrust in Richard&rsquo;s
      mind. He walked back again along the deck by himself. He looked absently
      in the main cabin as he passed it. The store-room skylight came next. In
      his present frame of mind, would he look absently into the store-room too?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; said Natalie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Launce only answered, &ldquo;Say yes,&rdquo; and held her as if he would never let her
      go again.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment Miss Lavinia&rsquo;s voice rose shrill from the deck calling
      for Natalie. There was but one way of getting free from him. She said,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think of it.&rdquo; Upon that, he kissed her and let her go.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door had barely closed on her when the lowering face of Richard
      Turlington appeared on a level with the side of the sky-light, looking
      down into the store-room at Launce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halloo!&rdquo; he called out roughly. &ldquo;What are you doing in the steward&rsquo;s
      room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Launce took up a box of matches on the dresser. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting a light,&rdquo; he
      answered readily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I allow nobody below, forward of the main cabin, without my leave. The
      steward has permitted a breach of discipline on board my vessel. The
      steward will leave my service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The steward is not to blame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the judge of that. Not you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Launce opened his lips to reply. An outbreak between the two men appeared
      to be inevitable, when the sailing-master of the yacht joined his employer
      on deck, and directed Turlington&rsquo;s attention to a question which is never
      to be trifled with at sea, the question of wind and tide.
    </p>
    <p>
      The yacht was then in the Bristol Channel, at the entrance to Bideford
      Bay. The breeze, fast freshening, was also fast changing the direction
      from which it blew. The favorable tide had barely three hours more to run.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wind&rsquo;s shifting, sir,&rdquo; said the sailing-master. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we shan&rsquo;t
      get round the point this tide, unless we lay her off on the other tack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turlington shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are letters waiting for me at Bideford,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We have lost two
      days in the calm. I must send ashore to the post-office, whether we lose
      the tide or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The vessel held on her course. Off the port of Bideford, the boat was sent
      ashore to the post-office, the yacht standing off and on, waiting the
      appearance of the letters. In the shortest time in which it was possible
      to bring them on board the letters were in Turlington&rsquo;s hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men were hauling the boat up to the davits, the yacht was already
      heading off from the land, when Turlington startled everybody by one
      peremptory word&mdash;&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had thrust all his letters but one into the pocket of his sailing
      jacket, without reading them. The one letter which he had opened he held
      in his closed hand. Rage was in his staring eyes, consternation was on his
      pale lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lower the boat!&rdquo; he shouted; &ldquo;I must get to London to-night.&rdquo; He stopped
      Sir Joseph, approaching him with opened mouth. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no time for
      questions and answers. I must get back.&rdquo; He swung himself over the side of
      the yacht, and addressed the sailing-master from the boat. &ldquo;Save the tide
      if you can; if you can&rsquo;t, put them ashore to-morrow at Minehead or Watchet&mdash;wherever
      they like.&rdquo; He beckoned to Sir Joseph to lean over the bulwark, and hear
      something he had to say in private. &ldquo;Remember what I told you about
      Launcelot Linzie!&rdquo; he whispered fiercely. His parting look was for
      Natalie. He spoke to her with a strong constraint on himself, as gently as
      he could. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed; I shall see you in London.&rdquo; He seated himself
      in the boat and took the tiller. The last words they heard him say were
      words urging the men at the oars to lose no time. He was invariably brutal
      with the men. &ldquo;Pull, you lazy beggars!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with an oath. &ldquo;Pull
      for your lives!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THIRD SCENE.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The Money Market.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Let us be serious.&mdash;Business!
    </p>
    <p>
      The new scene plunges us head foremost into the affairs of the Levant
      trading-house of Pizzituti, Turlington &amp; Branca. What on earth do we
      know about the Levant Trade? Courage! If we have ever known what it is to
      want money we are perfectly familiar with the subject at starting. The
      Levant Trade does occasionally get into difficulties.&mdash;Turlington
      wanted money.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter which had been handed to him on board the yacht was from his
      third partner, Mr. Branca, and was thus expressed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A crisis in the trade. All right, so far&mdash;except our business with
      the small foreign firms. Bills to meet from those quarters, (say) forty
      thousand pounds&mdash;and, I fear, no remittances to cover them.
      Particulars stated in another letter addressed to you at Post-office,
      Ilfracombe. I am quite broken down with anxiety, and confined to my bed.
      Pizzituti is still detained at Smyrna. Come back at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The same evening Turlington was at his office in Austin Friars,
      investigating the state of affairs, with his head clerk to help him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stated briefly, the business of the firm was of the widely miscellaneous
      sort. They plied a brisk trade in a vast variety of commodities. Nothing
      came amiss to them, from Manchester cotton manufactures to Smyrna figs.
      They had branch houses at Alexandria and Odessa, and correspondents here,
      there, and everywhere, along the shores of the Mediterranean, and in the
      ports of the East. These correspondents were the persons alluded to in Mr.
      Branca&rsquo;s letter as &ldquo;small foreign firms;&rdquo; and they had produced the
      serious financial crisis in the affairs of the great house in Austin
      Friars, which had hurried Turlington up to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one of these minor firms claimed and received the privilege of
      drawing bills on Pizzituti, Turlington &amp; Branca for amounts varying
      from four to six thousand pounds&mdash;on no better security than a verbal
      understanding that the money to pay the bills should be forwarded before
      they fell due. Competition, it is needless to say, was at the bottom of
      this insanely reckless system of trading. The native firms laid it down as
      a rule that they would decline to transact business with any house in the
      trade which refused to grant them their privilege. In the ease of
      Turlington&rsquo;s house, the foreign merchants had drawn their bills on him for
      sums large in the aggregate, if not large in themselves; had long since
      turned those bills into cash in their own markets, for their own
      necessities; and had now left the money which their paper represented to
      be paid by their London correspondents as it fell due. In some instances,
      they had sent nothing but promises and excuses. In others, they had
      forwarded drafts on firms which had failed already, or which were about to
      fail, in the crisis. After first exhausting his resources in ready money,
      Mr. Branca had provided for the more pressing necessities by pledging the
      credit of the house, so far as he <i>could</i> pledge it without exciting
      suspicion of the truth. This done, there were actually left, between that
      time and Christmas, liabilities to be met to the extent of forty thousand
      pounds, without a farthing in hand to pay that formidable debt.
    </p>
    <p>
      After working through the night, this was the conclusion at which Richard
      Turlington arrived, when the rising sun looked in at him through the
      windows of his private room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole force of the blow had fallen on <i>him</i>. The share of his
      partners in the business was of the most trifling nature. The capital was
      his, the risk was his. Personally and privately, <i>he</i> had to find the
      money, or to confront the one other alternative&mdash;ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      How was the money to be found?
    </p>
    <p>
      With his position in the City, he had only to go to the famous
      money-lending and discounting house of Bulpit Brothers&mdash;reported to
      &ldquo;turn over&rdquo; millions in their business every year&mdash;and to supply
      himself at once with the necessary funds. Forty thousand pounds was a
      trifling transaction to Bulpit Brothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having got the money, how, in the present state of his trade, was the loan
      to be paid back?
    </p>
    <p>
      His thoughts reverted to his marriage with Natalie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curious!&rdquo; he said to himself, recalling his conversation with Sir Joseph
      on board the yacht. &ldquo;Graybrooke told me he would give his daughter half
      his fortune on her marriage. Half Graybrooke&rsquo;s fortune happens to be just
      forty thousand pounds!&rdquo; He took a turn in the room. No! It was impossible
      to apply to Sir Joseph. Once shake Sir Joseph&rsquo;s conviction of his
      commercial solidity, and the marriage would be certainly deferred&mdash;if
      not absolutely broken off. Sir Joseph&rsquo;s fortune could be made available,
      in the present emergency, in but one way&mdash;he might use it to repay
      his debt. He had only to make the date at which the loan expired coincide
      with the date of his marriage, and there was his father-in-law&rsquo;s money at
      his disposal, or at his wife&rsquo;s disposal&mdash;which meant the same thing.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s well I pressed Graybrooke about the marriage when I did!&rdquo; he
      thought. &ldquo;I can borrow the money at a short date. In three months from
      this Natalie will be my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drove to his club to get breakfast, with his mind cleared, for the time
      being, of all its anxieties but one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing where he could procure the loan, he was by no means equally sure
      of being able to find the security on which he could borrow the money.
      Living up to his income; having no expectations from any living creature;
      possessing in landed property only some thirty or forty acres in
      Somersetshire, with a quaint little dwelling, half farm house,
      half-cottage, attached&mdash;he was incapable of providing the needful
      security from his own personal resources. To appeal to wealthy friends in
      the City would be to let those friends into the secret of his
      embarrassments, and to put his credit in peril. He finished his breakfast,
      and went back to Austin Friars&mdash;failing entirely, so far, to see how
      he was to remove the last obstacle now left in his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doors were open to the public; business had begun. He had not been ten
      minutes in his room before the shipping-clerk knocked at the door and
      interrupted him, still absorbed in his own anxious thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked, irritably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duplicate Bills of Lading, sir,&rdquo; answered the clerk, placing the
      documents on his ma ster&rsquo;s table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Found! There was the security on his writing-desk, staring him in the
      face! He dismissed the clerk and examined the papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      They contained an account of goods shipped to the London house on board
      vessels sailing from Smyrna and Odessa, and they were signed by the
      masters of the ships, who thereby acknowledged the receipt of the goods,
      and undertook to deliver them safely to the persons owning them, as
      directed. First copies of these papers had already been placed in the
      possession of the London house. The duplicates had now followed, in case
      of accident. Richard Turlington instantly determined to make the
      duplicates serve as his security, keeping the first copies privately under
      lock and key, to be used in obtaining possession of the goods at the
      customary time. The fraud was a fraud in appearance only. The security was
      a pure formality. His marriage would supply him with the funds needed for
      repaying the money, and the profits of his business would provide, in
      course of time, for restoring the dowry of his wife. It was simply a
      question of preserving his credit by means which were legitimately at his
      disposal. Within the lax limits of mercantile morality, Richard Turlington
      had a conscience. He put on his hat and took his false security to the
      money-lenders, without feeling at all lowered in his own estimation as an
      honest man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bulpit Brothers, long desirous of having such a name as his on their
      books, received him with open arms. The security (covering the amount
      borrowed) was accepted as a matter of course. The money was lent, for
      three months, with a stroke of the pen. Turlington stepped out again into
      the street, and confronted the City of London in the character of the
      noblest work of mercantile creation&mdash;a solvent man.*
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fallen Angel, walking invisibly behind, in Richard&rsquo;s shadow, flapped
      his crippled wings in triumph. From that moment the Fallen Angel had got
      him.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * It may not be amiss to remind the incredulous reader that
     a famous firm in the City accepted precisely the same
     security as that here accepted by Bulpit Brothers, with the
     same sublime indifference to troubling themselves by making
     any inquiry about it.

    <h2>
      FOURTH SCENE.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Muswell Hill.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The next day Turlington drove to the suburbs, on the chance of finding the
      Graybrookes at home again. Sir Joseph disliked London, and could not
      prevail on himself to live any nearer to the metropolis than Muswell Hill.
      When Natalie wanted a change, and languished for balls, theaters,
      flower-shows, and the like, she had a room especially reserved for her in
      the house of Sir Joseph&rsquo;s married sister, Mrs. Sancroft, living in that
      central deep of the fashionable whirlpool known among mortals as Berkeley
      Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his way through the streets, Turlington encountered a plain proof that
      the Graybrookes must have returned. He was passed by Launce, driving, in
      company with a gentleman, in a cab. The gentleman was Launce&rsquo;s brother,
      and the two were on their way to the Commissioners of Police to make the
      necessary arrangements for instituting an inquiry into Turlington&rsquo;s early
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the gate of the villa, the information received only partially
      fulfilled the visitor&rsquo;s expectations. The family had returned on the
      previous evening. Sir Joseph and his sister were at home, but Natalie was
      away again already. She had driven into town to lunch with her aunt.
      Turlington went into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you lost any money?&rdquo; Those were the first words uttered by Sir
      Joseph when he and Richard met again, after the parting on board the
      yacht.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a farthing. I might have lost seriously, if I had not got back in
      time to set things straight. Stupidity on the part of my people left in
      charge&mdash;nothing more. It&rsquo;s all right now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Joseph lifted his eyes, with heartfelt devotion, to the ceiling.
      &ldquo;Thank God, Richard!&rdquo; he said, in tones of the deepest feeling. He rang
      the bell. &ldquo;Tell Miss Graybrooke Mr. Turlington is here.&rdquo; He turned again
      to Richard. &ldquo;Lavinia is like me&mdash;Lavinia has been so anxious about
      you. We have both of us passed a sleepless night.&rdquo; Miss Lavinia came in.
      Sir Joseph hurried to meet her, and took her affectionately by both hands.
      &ldquo;My dear! the best of all good news, Richard has not lost a farthing.&rdquo;
       Miss Lavinia lifted <i>her</i> eyes to the ceiling with heartfelt
      devotion, and said, &ldquo;Thank God, Richard!&rdquo;&mdash;like the echo of her
      brother&rsquo;s voice; a little late, perhaps, for its reputation as an echo,
      but accurate to half a note in its perfect repetition of sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turlington asked the question which it had been his one object to put in
      paying his visit to Muswell Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you spoken to Natalie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning,&rdquo; replied Sir Joseph. &ldquo;An opportunity offered itself after
      breakfast. I took advantage of it, Richard&mdash;you shall hear how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He settled himself in his chair for one of his interminable stories; he
      began his opening sentence&mdash;and stopped, struck dumb at the first
      word. There was an unexpected obstacle in the way&mdash;his sister was not
      attending to him; his sister had silenced him at starting. The story
      touching, this time, on the question of marriage, Miss Lavinia had her
      woman&rsquo;s interest in seeing full justice done to the subject. She seized on
      her brother&rsquo;s narrative as on property in her own right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joseph should have told you,&rdquo; she began, addressing herself to
      Turlington, &ldquo;that our dear girl was unusually depressed in spirits this
      morning. Quite in the right frame of mind for a little serious talk about
      her future life. She ate nothing at breakfast, poor child, but a morsel of
      dry toast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And marmalade,&rdquo; said Sir Joseph, striking in at the first opportunity.
      The story, on this occasion, being Miss Lavinia&rsquo;s story, the polite
      contradictions necessary to its successful progress were naturally
      transferred from the sister to the brother, and became contradictions on
      Sir Joseph&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Miss Lavinia, gently, &ldquo;if you <i>will</i> have it, Joseph&mdash;jam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; persisted Sir Joseph; &ldquo;marmalade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What <i>does</i> it matter, brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister! the late great and good Doctor Johnson said accuracy ought always
      to be studied even in the most trifling things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>will</i> have your way, Joseph&mdash;&ldquo;(this was the formula&mdash;answering
      to Sir Joseph&rsquo;s &lsquo;Let us waive the point&rsquo;&mdash;which Miss Lavinia used, as
      a means of conciliating her brother, and getting a fresh start for her
      story). &ldquo;Well, we took dear Natalie out between us, after breakfast, for a
      little walk in the grounds. My brother opened the subject with infinite
      delicacy and tact. &lsquo;Circumstances,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;into which it was not then
      necessary to enter, made it very desirable, young as she was, to begin to
      think of her establishment in life.&rsquo; And then he referred, Richard (so
      nicely), to your faithful and devoted attachment&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, Lavinia. I began with Richard&rsquo;s attachment, and then I got on
      to her establishment in life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse <i>me</i>, Joseph. You managed it much more delicately than you
      suppose. You didn&rsquo;t drag Richard in by the head and shoulders in that
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lavinia! I began with Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joseph! your memory deceives you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turlington&rsquo;s impatience broke through all restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did it end?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Did you propose to her that we should be
      married in the first week of the New Year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said Miss Lavinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Sir Joseph.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sister looked at the brother with an expression of affectionate
      surprise. The brother looked at the sister with a fund of amiable
      contradiction, expressed in a low bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really mean to deny, Joseph, that you told Natalie we had decided
      on the first week in the New Year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I deny the New Year, Lavinia. I said early in January.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>will</i> have your way, Joseph! We were walking in the shrubbery
      at the time. I had our dear girl&rsquo;s arm in mine, and I felt it tremble. She
      suddenly stopped. &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;not so soon!&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;My dear,
      consider Richard!&rsquo; She turned to her father. She said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t, pray don&rsquo;t
      press it so soon, papa! I respect Richard; I like Richard as your true and
      faithful friend; but I don&rsquo;t love him as I ought to love him if I am to be
      his wife.&rsquo; Imagine her talking in that way! What could she possibly know
      about it? Of course we both laughed&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>you</i> laughed, Lavinia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>you</i> laughed, Joseph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get on, for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; cried Turlington, striking his hand passionately
      on the table by which he was sitting. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t madden me by contradicting
      each other! Did she give way or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lavinia turned to her brother. &ldquo;Contradicting each other, Joseph!&rdquo;
       she exclaimed, lifting her hands in blank amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Contradicting each other!&rdquo; repeated Sir Joseph, equally astonished on his
      side. &ldquo;My dear Richard, what can you be thinking of? I contradict my
      sister! We never disagreed in our lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I contradict my brother! We have never had a cross word between us from
      the time when we were children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turlington internally cursed his own irritable temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon&mdash;both of you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what I was
      saying. Make some allowance for me. All my hopes in life are centered in
      Natalie; and you have just told me (in her own words, Miss Lavinia) that
      she doesn&rsquo;t love. You don&rsquo;t mean any harm, I dare say; but you cut me to
      the heart.&rdquo;

      This confession, and the look that accompanied it, touched the ready
      sympathies of the two old people in the right place. The remainder of the
      story dropped between them by common consent. They vied with each other in
      saying the comforting words which would allay their dear Richard&rsquo;s
      anxiety. How little he knew of young girls. How could he be so foolish,
      poor fellow! as to attach any serious importance to what Natalie had said?
      As if a young creature in her teens knew the state of her own heart!
      Protestations and entreaties were matters of course, in such cases. Tears
      even might be confidently expected from a right-minded girl. It had all
      ended exactly as Richard would have wished it to end. Sir Joseph had said,
      &ldquo;My child! this is a matter of experience; love will come when you are
      married.&rdquo; And Miss Lavinia had added, &ldquo;Dear Natalie, if you remembered
      your poor mother as I remember her, you would know that your father&rsquo;s
      experience is to be relied on.&rdquo; In that way they had put it to her; and
      she had hung her head and had given&mdash;all that maiden modesty could be
      expected to give&mdash;a silent consent. &ldquo;The wedding-day was fixed for
      the first week in the New Year.&rdquo; (&ldquo;No, Joseph; not January&mdash;the New
      Year.&rdquo;) &ldquo;And God bless you, Richard! and may your married life be a long
      and happy one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the average ignorance of human nature, and the average belief in
      conventional sentiment, complacently contemplated the sacrifice of one
      more victim on the all-devouring altar of Marriage! So Sir Joseph and his
      sister provided Launcelot Linzie with the one argument which he wanted to
      convince Natalie: &ldquo;Choose between making the misery of your life by
      marrying <i>him</i>, and making the happiness of your life by marrying <i>me.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When shall I see her?&rdquo; asked Turlington, with Miss Lavinia (in tears
      which did <i>her</i> credit) in possession of one of his hands, and Sir
      Joseph (in tears which did <i>him</i> credit) in possession of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will be back to dinner, dear Richard. Stay and dine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. I must go into the City first. I will come back and dine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that arrangement in prospect, he left them.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later a telegram arrived from Natalie. She had consented to dine,
      as well as lunch, in Berkeley Square&mdash;sleeping there that night, and
      returning the next morning. Her father instantly telegraphed back by the
      messenger, insisting on Natalie&rsquo;s return to Muswell Hill that evening, in
      time to meet Richard Turlington at dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right. Joseph,&rdquo; said Miss Lavinia, looking over her brother&rsquo;s
      shoulder, while he wrote the telegram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is showing a disposition to coquet with Richard,&rdquo; rejoined Sir
      Joseph, with the air of a man who knew female human nature in its remotest
      corners. &ldquo;My telegram, Lavinia, will have its effect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Joseph was quite right. His telegram <i>had</i> its effect. It not
      only brought his daughter back to dinner&mdash;it produced another result
      which his prophetic faculty had altogether failed to foresee.
    </p>
    <p>
      The message reached Berkeley Square at five o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. Let
      us follow the message.

    <h2>
      FIFTH SCENE.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The Square.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Between four and five in the afternoon&mdash;when the women of the Western
      regions are in their carriages, and the men are at their clubs&mdash;London
      presents few places more conveniently adapted for purposes of private talk
      than the solitary garden inclosure of a square.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day when Richard Turlington paid his visit to Muswell Hill, two
      ladies (with a secret between them) unlocked the gate of the railed garden
      in Berkeley Square. They shut the gate after entering the inclosure, but
      carefully forbore to lock it as well, and carefully restricted their walk
      to the westward side of the garden. One of them was Natalie Graybrooke.
      The other was Mrs. Sancroft&rsquo;s eldest daughter. A certain temporary
      interest attached, in the estimation of society, to this young lady. She
      had sold well in the marriage market. In other words, she had recently
      been raised to the position of Lord Winwood&rsquo;s second wife; his lordship
      conferring on the bride not only the honors of the peerage, but the
      additional distinction of being stepmother to his three single daughters,
      all older than herself. In person, Lady Winwood was little and fair. In
      character, she was dashing and resolute&mdash;a complete contrast to
      Natalie, and (on that very account) Natalie&rsquo;s bosom friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, one ambitious marriage in the family is quite enough! I have
      made up my mind that <i>you</i> shall marry the man you love. Don&rsquo;t tell
      me your courage is failing you&mdash;the excuse is contemptible; I decline
      to receive it. Natalie! the men have a phrase which exactly describes your
      character. You want back-bone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bonnet of the lady who expressed herself in these peremptory terms
      barely reached the height of Natalie&rsquo;s shoulder. Natalie might have blown
      the little airy, light-haired, unsubstantial creature over the railings of
      the garden if she had taken a good long breath and stooped low enough. But
      who ever met with a tall woman who had a will of her own? Natalie&rsquo;s
      languid brown eyes looked softly down in submissive attention from an
      elevation of five feet seven. Lady Winwood&rsquo;s brisk blue eyes looked
      brightly up in despotic command from an elevation of four feet eleven (in
      her shoes).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are trifling with Mr. Linzie, my dear. Mr. Linzie is a nice fellow. I
      like him. I won&rsquo;t have that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Louisa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Turlington has nothing to recommend him. He is not a well-bred old
      gentleman of exalted rank. He is only an odious brute who happens to have
      made money. You shall <i>not</i> marry Mr. Turlington. And you <i>shall</i>
      marry Launcelot Linzie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you let me speak, Louisa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will let you answer&mdash;nothing more. Didn&rsquo;t you come crying to me
      this morning? Didn&rsquo;t you say, &lsquo;Louisa, they have pronounced sentence on
      me! I am to be married in the first week of the New Year. Help me out of
      it, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake!&rsquo; You said all that, and more. And what did I do
      when I heard your story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you were so kind&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kind doesn&rsquo;t half express it. I have committed crimes on your account. I
      have deceived my husband and my mother. For your sake I got mamma to ask
      Mr. Linzie to lunch (as <i>my</i> friend!). For your sake I have banished
      my unoffending husband, not an hour since, to his club. You wretched girl,
      who arranged a private conference in the library? Who sent Mr. Linzie off
      to consult his friend in the Temple on the law of clandestine marriage?
      Who suggested your telegraphing home, and stopping here for the night? Who
      made an appointment to meet your young man privately in this detestable
      place in ten minutes&rsquo; time? I did! I did! I did! All in your interests.
      All to prevent you from doing what I have done&mdash;marrying to please
      your family instead of to please yourself. (I don&rsquo;t complain, mind, of
      Lord Winwood, or of his daughters. <i>He</i> is charming; his daughters I
      shall tame in course of time. You are different. And Mr. Turlington, as I
      observed before, is a brute.) Very well. Now what do you owe me on your
      side? You owe it to me at least to know your own mind. You don&rsquo;t know it.
      You coolly inform me that you daren&rsquo;t run the risk after all, and that you
      can&rsquo;t face the consequences on second thoughts. I&rsquo;ll tell you what! You
      don&rsquo;t deserve that nice fellow, who worships the very ground you tread on.
      You are a bread-and-butter miss. I don&rsquo;t believe you are fond of him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not fond of him!&rdquo; Natalie stopped, and clasped her hands in despair of
      finding language strong enough for the occasion. At the same moment the
      sound of a closing gate caught her ear. She looked round. Launce had kept
      his appointment before his time. Launce was in the garden, rapidly
      approaching them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for the Law of Clandestine Marriage!&rdquo; said Lady Winwood. &ldquo;Mr. Linzie,
      we will take it sitting.&rdquo; She led the way to one of the benches in the
      garden, and placed Launce between Natalie and herself. &ldquo;Well, Chief
      Conspirator, have you got the License? No? Does it cost too much? Can I
      lend you the money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It costs perjury, Lady Winwood, in my case,&rdquo; said Launce. &ldquo;Natalie is not
      of age. I can only get a License by taking my oath that I marry her with
      her father&rsquo;s consent.&rdquo; He turned piteously to Natalie. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t very
      well do that,&rdquo; he said, in the tone of a man who feels bound to make an
      apology, &ldquo;could I?&rdquo; Natalie shuddered; Lady Winwood shrugged her
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your place a woman wouldn&rsquo;t have hesitated,&rdquo; her ladyship remarked.
      &ldquo;But men are so selfish. Well! I suppose there is some other way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there is another way,&rdquo; said Launce. &ldquo;But there is a horrid condition
      attached to it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something worse than perjury, Mr. Linzie? Murder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you directly, Lady Winwood. The marriage comes first. The
      condition follows. There is only one chance for us. We must be married by
      banns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Banns!&rdquo; cried Natalie. &ldquo;Why, banns are publicly proclaimed in church!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They needn&rsquo;t be proclaimed in <i>your</i> church, you goose,&rdquo; said Lady
      Winwood. &ldquo;And, even if they were, nobody would be the wiser. You may trust
      implicitly, my dear, in the elocution of an English clergyman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what my friend said,&rdquo; cried Launce. &ldquo;&lsquo;Take a lodging near a
      large parish church, in a remote part of London&rsquo;&mdash;(this is my
      friend&rsquo;s advice)&mdash;&lsquo;go to the clerk, tell him you want to be married
      by banns, and say you belong to that parish. As for the lady, in your
      place I should simplify it. I should say she belonged to the parish too.
      Give an address, and have some one there to answer questions. How is the
      clerk to know? He isn&rsquo;t likely to be over-anxious about it&mdash;his fee
      is eighteen-pence. The clerk makes his profit out of you, after you are
      married. The same rule applies to the parson. He will have your names
      supplied to him on a strip of paper, with dozens of other names; and he
      will read them out all together in one inarticulate jumble in church. You
      will stand at the altar when your time comes, with Brown and Jones, Nokes
      and Styles, Jack and Gill. All that you will have to do is, to take care
      that your young lady doesn&rsquo;t fall to Jack, and you to Gill, by mistake&mdash;and
      there you are, married by banns.&rsquo; My friend&rsquo;s opinion, stated in his own
      words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Natalie sighed, and wrung her hands in her lap. &ldquo;We shall never get
      through it,&rdquo; she said, despondingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Winwood took a more cheerful view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see nothing very formidable as yet, my dear. But we have still to hear
      the end of it. You mentioned a condition just now, Mr. Linzie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am coming to the condition, Lady Winwood. You naturally suppose, as I
      did, that I put Natalie into a cab, and run away with her from the church
      door?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. And I throw an old shoe after you for luck, and go home
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Launce shook his head ominously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Natalie must go home again as well as you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Winwood started. &ldquo;Is that the condition you mentioned just now?&rdquo; she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the condition. I may marry her without anything serious coming of
      it. But, if I run away with her afterward, and if you are there, aiding
      and abetting me, we are guilty of Abduction, and we may stand, side by
      side, at the bar of the Old Bailey to answer for it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Natalie sprang to her feet in horror. Lady Winwood held up one finger
      warningly, signing to her to let Launce go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Natalie is not yet sixteen years old,&rdquo; Launce proceeded. &ldquo;She must go
      straight back to her father&rsquo;s house from the church, and I must wait to
      run away with her till her next birthday. When she&rsquo;s turned sixteen, she&rsquo;s
      ripe for elopement&mdash;not an hour before. There is the law of
      Abduction! Despotism in a free country&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I call it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Natalie sat down again, with an air of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very comforting law, I think,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t force one to
      take the dreadful step of running away from home all at once. It gives one
      time to consider, and plan, and make up one&rsquo;s mind. I can tell you this,
      Launce, if I am to be persuaded into marrying you, the law of Abduction is
      the only thing that will induce me to do it. You ought to thank the law,
      instead of abusing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Launce listened&mdash;without conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pleasant prospect,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to part at the church door, and to
      treat my own wife on the footing of a young lady who is engaged to marry
      another gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it any pleasanter for <i>me</i>,&rdquo; retorted Natalie, &ldquo;to have Richard
      Turlington courting me, when I am all the time your wife? I shall never be
      able to do it. I wish I was dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! come!&rdquo; interposed Lady Winwood. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to be serious. Natalie&rsquo;s
      birthday, Mr. Linzie, is next Christmas-day. She will be sixteen&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At seven in the morning,&rdquo; said Launce; &ldquo;I got that out of Sir Joseph. At
      one minute past seven, Greenwich mean time, we may be off together. I got
      <i>that</i> out of the lawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it isn&rsquo;t an eternity to wait from now till Christmas-day. You get
      that, by way of completing the list of your acquisitions, out of <i>me</i>.
      In the mean time, can you, or can you not, manage to meet the difficulties
      in the way of the marriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have settled everything,&rdquo; Launce answered, confidently. &ldquo;There is not a
      single difficulty left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned to Natalie, listening to him in amazement, and explained
      himself. It had struck him that he might appeal&mdash;with his purse in
      his hand, of course&mdash;to the interest felt in his affairs by the late
      stewardess of the yacht. That excellent woman had volunteered to do all
      that she could to help him. Her husband had obtained situations for his
      wife and himself on board another yacht&mdash;and they were both eager to
      assist in any conspiracy in which their late merciless master was destined
      to play the part of victim. When on shore, they lived in a populous London
      parish, far away from the fashionable district of Berkeley Square, and
      further yet from the respectable suburb of Muswell Hill. A room in the
      house could be nominally engaged for Natalie, in the assumed character of
      the stewardess&rsquo;s niece&mdash;the stewardess undertaking to answer any
      purely formal questions which might be put by the church authorities, and
      to be present at the marriage ceremony. As for Launce, he would actually,
      as well as nominally, live in the district close by; and the steward, if
      needful, would answer for <i>him</i>. Natalie might call at her parochial
      residence occasionally, under the wing of Lady Winwood; gaining leave of
      absence from Muswell Hill, on the plea of paying one of her customary
      visits at her aunt&rsquo;s house. The conspiracy, in brief, was arranged in all
      its details. Nothing was now wanting but the consent of the young lady;
      obtaining which, Launce would go to the parish church and give the
      necessary notice of a marriage by banns on the next day. There was the
      plot. What did the ladies think of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Winwood thought it perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Natalie was not so easily satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father has always been so kind to me!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The one thing I
      can&rsquo;t get over, Launce, is distressing papa. If he had been hard on me&mdash;as
      some fathers are&mdash;I shouldn&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo; She suddenly brightened, as if
      she saw her position in a new light. &ldquo;Why should you hurry me?&rdquo; she asked.
      &ldquo;I am going to dine at my aunt&rsquo;s to-day, and you are coming in the
      evening. Give me time! Wait till to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Launce instantly entered his protest against wasting a moment longer. Lady
      Winwood opened her lips to support him. They were both silenced at the
      same moment by the appearance of one of Mrs. Sancroft&rsquo;s servants, opening
      the gate of the square.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Winwood went forward to meet the man. A suspicion crossed her mind
      that he might be bringing bad news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, my lady&mdash;the housekeeper said you were walking
      here with Miss Graybrooke. A telegram for Miss Graybrooke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Winwood took the telegram from the man&rsquo;s hand; dismissed him, and
      went back with it to Natalie. Natalie opened it nervously. She read the
      message&mdash;and instantly changed. Her cheeks flushed deep; her eyes
      flashed with indignation. &ldquo;Even papa can be hard on me, it seems, when
      Richard asks him!&rdquo; she exclaimed. She handed the telegram to Launce. Her
      eyes suddenly filled with tears. &ldquo;<i>You</i> love me,&rdquo; she said, gently&mdash;and
      stopped. &ldquo;Marry me!&rdquo; she added, with a sudden burst of resolution. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      risk it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke those words, Lady Winwood read the telegram. It ran thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Joseph Graybrooke, Muswell Hill. To Miss Natalie Graybrooke; Berkeley
      Square. Come back immediately. You are engaged to dine here with Richard
      Turlington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Winwood folded up the telegram with a malicious smile. &ldquo;Well done,
      Sir Joseph!&rdquo; thought her ladyship. &ldquo;We might never have persuaded Natalie&mdash;but
      for You!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      SIXTH SCENE.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The Church.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The time is morning; the date is early in the month of November. The place
      is a church, in a poor and populous parish in the undiscovered regions of
      London, eastward of the Tower, and hard by the river-side.
    </p>
    <p>
      A marriage procession of five approaches the altar The bridegroom is pale,
      and the bride is frightened. The bride&rsquo;s friend (a resolute-looking little
      lady) encourages her in whispers. The two respectable persons, apparently
      man and wife, who complete the procession, seem to be not quite clear as
      to the position which they occupy at the ceremony. The beadle, as he
      marshals them before the altar, sees something under the surface in this
      wedding-party. Marriages in the lower ranks of life are the only marriages
      celebrated here. Is this a runaway match? The beadle anticipates something
      out of the common in the shape of a fee.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clergyman (the junior curate) appears from the vestry in his robes.
      The clerk takes his place. The clergyman&rsquo;s eye rests with a sudden
      interest and curiosity on the bride and bridegroom, and on the bride&rsquo;s
      friend; notices the absence of elderly relatives; remarks, in the two
      ladies especially, evidences of refinement and breeding entirely
      unparalleled in his professional experience of brides and brides&rsquo; friends
      standing before the altar of that church; questions, silently and quickly,
      the eye of the clerk, occupied also in observing the strangers with
      interest &ldquo;Jenkinson&rdquo; (the clergyman&rsquo;s look asks), &ldquo;is this all right?&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Sir&rdquo; (the clerk&rsquo;s look answers), &ldquo;a marriage by banns; all the
      formalities have been observed.&rdquo; The clergyman opens his book. The
      formalities have been observed; his duty lies plainly before him.
      Attention, Launcelot! Courage, Natalie! The service begins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Launce casts a last furtive look round the church. Will Sir Joseph
      Graybrooke start up and stop it from one of the empty pews? Is Richard
      Turlington lurking in the organ-loft, and only waiting till the words of
      the service appeal to him to prohibit the marriage, or &ldquo;else hereafter
      forever to hold his peace?&rdquo; No. The clergyman proceeds steadily, and
      nothing happens. Natalie&rsquo;s charming face grows paler and paler, Natalie&rsquo;s
      heart throbs faster and faster, as the time comes nearer for reading the
      words which unite them for life. Lady Winwood herself feels an
      unaccustomed fluttering in the region of the bosom. Her ladyship&rsquo;s
      thoughts revert, not altogether pleasantly, to her own marriage: &ldquo;Ah me!
      what was I thinking of when I was in this position? Of the bride&rsquo;s
      beautiful dress, and of Lady Winwood&rsquo;s coming presentation at court!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The service advances to the words in which they plight their troth. Launce
      has put the ring on her finger. Launce has repeated the words after the
      clergyman. Launce has married her! Done! Come what may of it, done!
    </p>
    <p>
      The service ends. Bridegroom, bride, and witnesses go into the vestry to
      sign the book. The signing, like the service, is serious. No trifling with
      the truth is possible here. When it comes to Lady Winwood&rsquo;s turn, Lady
      Winwood must write her name. She does it, but without her usual grace and
      decision. She drops her handkerchief. The clerk picks it up for her, and
      notices that a coronet is embroidered in one corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fees are paid. They leave the vestry. Other couples, when it is over,
      are talkative and happy. These two are more silent and more embarrassed
      than ever. Stranger still, while other couples go off with relatives and
      friends, all socially united in honor of the occasion, these two and their
      friends part at the church door. The respectable man and his wife go their
      way on foot. The little lady with the coronet on her handkerchief puts the
      bride into a cab, gets in herself, and directs the driver to close the
      door, while the bridegroom is standing on the church steps! The
      bridegroom&rsquo;s face is clouded, as well it may be. He puts his head in at
      the window of the cab; he possesses himself of the bride&rsquo;s hand; he speaks
      in a whisper; he is apparently not to be shaken off. The little lady
      exerts her authority, separates the clasped hands, pushes the bridegroom
      away, and cries peremptorily to the driver to go on. The cab starts; the
      deserted husband drifts desolately anyhow down the street. The clerk, who
      has seen it all, goes back to the vestry and reports what has happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rector (with his wife on his arm) has just dropped into the vestry on
      business in passing. He and the curate are talking about the strange
      marriage. The rector, gravely bent on ascertaining that no blame rests
      with the church, interrogates, and is satisfied. The rector&rsquo;s wife is not
      so easy to deal with. She has looked at the signatures in the book. One of
      the names is familiar to her. She cross-examines the clerk as soon as her
      husband is done with him. When she hears of the coronet on the
      handkerchief she points to the signature of &ldquo;Louisa Winwood,&rdquo; and says to
      the rector, &ldquo;I know who it is! Lord Winwood&rsquo;s second wife. I went to
      school with his lordship&rsquo;s daughters by his first marriage. We
      occasionally meet at the Sacred Concerts (on the &lsquo;Ladies&rsquo; Committee&rsquo;); I
      shall find an opportunity of speaking to them. One moment, Mr. Jenkinson,
      I will write down the names before you put away the book. &lsquo;Launcelot
      Linzie,&rsquo; &lsquo;Natalie Graybrooke.&rsquo; Very pretty names; quite romantic. I do
      delight in a romance. Good-morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gives the curate a parting smile, and the clerk a parting nod, and
      sails out of the vestry. Natalie, silently returning in Lady Winwood&rsquo;s
      company to Muswell Hill; and Launce, cursing the law of Abduction as he
      roams the streets&mdash;little think that the ground is already mined
      under their feet. Richard Turlington may hear of it now, or may hear of it
      later. The discovery of the marriage depends entirely on a chance meeting
      between the lord&rsquo;s daughters and the rector&rsquo;s wife.

      MR. TURLINGTON,
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY WINWOOD At Home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wednesday, December 15th.&mdash;Ten o&rsquo;clock. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest Natalie&mdash;As the brute insists, the brute must have the
      invitation which I inclose. Never mind, my child. You and Launce are
      coming to dinner, and I will see that you have your little private
      opportunities of retirement afterward. All I expect of you in return is,
      <i>not</i> to look (when you come back) as if your husband had been
      kissing you. You will certainly let out the secret of those stolen kisses,
      if you don&rsquo;t take care. At mamma&rsquo;s dinner yesterday, your color (when you
      came out of the conservatory) was a sight to see. Even your shoulders were
      red! They are charming shoulders, I know, and men take the strangest
      fancies sometimes. But, my dear, suppose you wear a chemisette next time,
      if you haven&rsquo;t authority enough over him to prevent his doing it again!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your affectionate LOUISA.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The private history of the days that had passed since the marriage was
      written in that letter. An additional chapter&mdash;of some importance in
      its bearing on the future&mdash;was contributed by the progress of events
      at Lady Winwood&rsquo;s party.
    </p>
    <p>
      By previous arrangement with Natalie, the Graybrookes (invited to dinner)
      arrived early. Leaving her husband and her stepdaughters to entertain Sir
      Joseph and Miss Lavinia, Lady Winwood took Natalie into her own boudoir,
      which communicated by a curtained opening with the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, you are looking positively haggard this evening. Has anything
      happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am nearly worn out, Louisa. The life I am leading is so unendurable
      that, if Launce pressed me, I believe I should consent to run away with
      him when we leave your house tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will do nothing of the sort, if you please. Wait till you are
      sixteen. I delight in novelty, but the novelty of appearing at the Old
      Bailey is beyond my ambition. Is the brute coming to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. He insists on following me wherever I go. He lunched at
      Muswell Hill today. More complaints of my incomprehensible coldness to
      him. Another scolding from papa. A furious letter from Launce. If I let
      Richard kiss my hand again in his presence, Launce warns me he will knock
      him down. Oh, the meanness and the guiltiness of the life I am leading
      now! I am in the falsest of all false positions, Louisa, and you
      encouraged me to do it. I believe Richard Turlington suspects us. The last
      two times Launce and I tried to get a minute together at my aunt&rsquo;s, he
      contrived to put himself in our way. There he was, my dear, with his
      scowling face, looking as if he longed to kill Launce. Can you do anything
      for us tonight? Not on my account. But Launce is so impatient. If he can&rsquo;t
      say two words to me alone this evening, he declares he will come to
      Muswell Hill, and catch me in the garden tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Compose yourself, my dear; he shall say his two words to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Winwood pointed through the curtained entrance of the boudoir to the
      door of the drawing-room. Beyond the door was the staircase landing. And
      beyond the landing was a second drawing-room, the smaller of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are only three or four people coming to dinner,&rdquo; her ladyship
      proceeded; &ldquo;and a few more in the evening. Being a small party, the small
      drawing-room will do for us. This drawing-room will not be lighted, and
      there will be only my reading-lamp here in the boudoir. I shall give the
      signal for leaving the dining-room earlier than usual. Launce will join us
      before the evening party begins. The moment he appears, send him in here&mdash;boldly
      before your aunt and all of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For your fan. Leave it there under the sofa-cushion before we go down to
      dinner. You will sit next to Launce, and you will give him private
      instructions not to find the fan. You will get impatient&mdash;you will go
      to find it yourself&mdash;and there you are. Take care of your shoulders,
      Mrs. Linzie! I have nothing more to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The guests asked to dinner began to arrive. Lady Winwood was recalled to
      her duties as mistress of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a pleasant little dinner&mdash;with one drawback. It began too
      late. The ladies only reached the small drawing-room at ten minutes to
      ten. Launce was only able to join them as the clock struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late!&rdquo; whispered Natalie. &ldquo;He will be here directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody comes punctually to an evening party,&rdquo; said Launce. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us
      lose a moment. Send me for your fan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Natalie opened her lips to say the necessary words. Before she could
      speak, the servant announced&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Turlington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came in, with his stiffly-upright shirt collar and his loosely-fitting
      glossy black clothes. He made his sullen and clumsy bow to Lady Winwood.
      And then he did, what he had done dozens of times already&mdash;he caught
      Natalie, with her eyes still bright and her face still animated (after
      talking to Launce)&mdash;a striking contrast to the cold and unimpulsive
      young lady whom he was accustomed to see while Natalie was talking to <i>him</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Winwood&rsquo;s daughters were persons of some celebrity in the world of
      amateur music. Noticing the look that Turlington cast at Launce, Lady
      Winwood whispered to Miss Lavinia&mdash;who instantly asked the young
      ladies to sing. Launce, in obedience to a sign from Natalie, volunteered
      to find the music-books. It is needless to add that he pitched on the
      wrong volume at starting. As he lifted it from the piano to take it back
      to the stand, there dropped out from between the leaves a printed letter,
      looking like a circular. One of the young ladies took it up, and ran her
      eye over it, with a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Sacred Concerts!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her two sisters, standing by, looked at each other guiltily: &ldquo;What will
      the Committee say to us? We entirely forgot the meeting last month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there a meeting this month?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all looked anxiously at the printed letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! The twenty-third of December. Put it down in your book, Amelia.&rdquo;
       Amelia, then and there, put it down among the engagements for the latter
      end of the month. And Natalie&rsquo;s unacknowledged husband placidly looked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      So did the merciless irony of circumstances make Launce the innocent means
      of exposing his own secret to discovery. Thanks to his success in laying
      his hand on the wrong music-book, there would now be a meeting&mdash;two
      good days before the elopement could take place&mdash;between the lord&rsquo;s
      daughters and the rector&rsquo;s wife!
    </p>
    <p>
      The guests of the evening began to appear by twos and threes. The
      gentlemen below stairs left the dinner-table, and joined them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The small drawing-room was pleasantly filled, and no more. Sir Joseph
      Graybrooke, taking Turlington&rsquo;s hand, led him eagerly to their host. The
      talk in the dining-room had turned on finance. Lord Winwood was not quite
      satisfied with some of his foreign investments; and Sir Joseph&rsquo;s &ldquo;dear
      Richard&rdquo; was the very man to give him a little sound advice. The three
      laid their heads together in a corner. Launce (watching them) slyly
      pressed Natalie&rsquo;s hand. A renowned &ldquo;virtuoso&rdquo; had arrived, and was
      thundering on the piano. The attention of the guests generally was
      absorbed in the performance. A fairer chance of sending Launce for the fan
      could not possibly have offered itself. While the financial discussion was
      still proceeding, the married lovers were ensconced together alone in the
      boudoir.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Winwood (privately observant of their absence) kept her eye on the
      corner, watching Richard Turlington.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was talking earnestly&mdash;with his back toward the company. He
      neither moved nor looked round. It came to Lord Winwood&rsquo;s turn to speak.
      He preserved the same position, listening. Sir Joseph took up the
      conversation next. Then his attention wandered&mdash;he knew beforehand
      what Sir Joseph would say. His eyes turned anxiously toward the place in
      which he had left Natalie. Lord Winwood said a word. His head turned back
      again toward the corner. Sir Joseph put an objection. He glanced once more
      over his shoulder&mdash;this time at the place in which Launce had been
      standing. The next moment his host recalled his attention, and made it
      impossible for him to continue his scrutiny of the room. At the same times
      two among the evening guests, bound for another party, approached to take
      leave of the lady of the house. Lady Winwood was obliged to rise, and
      attend to them. They had something to say to her before they left, and
      they said it at terrible length, standing so as to intercept her view of
      the proceedings of the enemy. When she had got rid of them at last, she
      looked&mdash;and behold Lord Winwood and Sir Joseph were the only
      occupants of the corner!
    </p>
    <p>
      Delaying one moment, to set the &ldquo;virtuoso&rdquo; thundering once more, Lady
      Winwood slipped out of the room and crossed the landing. At the entrance
      to the empty drawing-room she heard Turlington&rsquo;s voice, low and
      threatening, in the boudoir. Jealousy has a Second Sight of its own. He
      had looked in the right place at starting&mdash;and, oh heavens! he had
      caught them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her ladyship&rsquo;s courage was beyond dispute; but she turned pale as she
      approached the entrance to the boudoir.
    </p>
    <p>
      There stood Natalie&mdash;at once angry and afraid&mdash;between the man
      to whom she was ostensibly engaged, and the man to whom she was actually
      married. Turlington&rsquo;s rugged face expressed a martyrdom of suppressed
      fury. Launce&mdash;in the act of offering Natalie her fan&mdash;smiled,
      with the cool superiority of a man who knew that he had won his advantage,
      and who triumphed in knowing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forbid you to take your fan from that man&rsquo;s hands,&rdquo; said Turlington,
      speaking to Natalie, and pointing to Launce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it rather too soon to begin &lsquo;forbidding&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Lady Winwood,
      good-humoredly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly what I say!&rdquo; exclaimed Launce. &ldquo;It seems necessary to remind Mr.
      Turlington that he is not married to Natalie yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those last words were spoken in a tone which made both the women tremble
      inwardly for results. Lady Winwood took the fan from Launce with one hand,
      and took Natalie&rsquo;s arm with the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is your fan, my dear,&rdquo; she said, in her easy off-hand manner. &ldquo;Why
      do you allow these two barbarous men to keep you here while the great
      Bootmann is playing the Nightmare Sonata in the next room? Launce! Mr.
      Turlington! follow me, and learn to be musical directly! You have only to
      shut your eyes, and you will fancy you hear four modern German composers
      playing, instead of one, and not the ghost of a melody among all the
      four.&rdquo; She led the way out with Natalie, and whispered, &ldquo;Did he catch
      you?&rdquo; Natalie whispered back, &ldquo;I heard him in time. He only caught us
      looking for the fan.&rdquo; The two men waited behind to have two words together
      alone in the boudoir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This doesn&rsquo;t end here, Mr. Linzie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Launce smiled satirically. &ldquo;For once I agree with you,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It
      doesn&rsquo;t end here, as you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Winwood stopped, and looked back at them from the drawing-room door.
      They were keeping her waiting&mdash;they had no choice but to follow the
      mistress of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived in the next room, both Turlington and Launce resumed their places
      among the guests with the same object in view. As a necessary result of
      the scene in the boudoir, each had his own special remonstrance to address
      to Sir Joseph. Even here, Launce was beforehand with Turlington. He was
      the first to get possession of Sir Joseph&rsquo;s private ear. His complaint
      took the form of a protest against Turlington&rsquo;s jealousy, and an appeal
      for a reconsideration of the sentence which excluded him from Muswell
      Hill. Watching them from a distance, Turlington&rsquo;s suspicious eye detected
      the appearance of something unduly confidential in the colloquy between
      the two. Under cover of the company, he stole behind them and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great Bootmann had arrived at that part of the Nightmare Sonata in
      which musical sound, produced principally with the left hand, is made to
      describe, beyond all possibility of mistake, the rising of the moon in a
      country church-yard and a dance of Vampires round a maiden&rsquo;s grave. Sir
      Joseph, having no chance against the Vampires in a whisper, was obliged to
      raise his voice to make himself audible in answering and comforting
      Launce. &ldquo;I sincerely sympathize with you,&rdquo; Turlington heard him say; &ldquo;and
      Natalie feels about it as I do. But Richard is an obstacle in our way. We
      must look to the consequences, my dear boy, supposing Richard found us
      out.&rdquo; He nodded kindly to his nephew; and, declining to pursue the
      subject, moved away to another part of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turlington&rsquo;s jealous distrust, wrought to the highest pitch of
      irritability for weeks past, instantly associated the words he had just
      heard with the words spoken by Launce in the boudoir, which had reminded
      him that he was not married to Natalie yet. Was there treachery at work
      under the surface? and was the object to persuade weak Sir Joseph to
      reconsider his daughter&rsquo;s contemplated marriage in a sense favorable to
      Launce? Turlington&rsquo;s blind suspicion overleaped at a bound all the
      manifest improbabilities which forbade such a conclusion as this. After an
      instant&rsquo;s consideration with himself, he decided on keeping his own
      counsel, and on putting Sir Joseph&rsquo;s good faith then and there to a test
      which he could rely on as certain to take Natalie&rsquo;s father by surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Graybrooke!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Joseph started at the sight of his future son-in-law&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Richard, you are looking very strangely! Is the heat of the room
      too much for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind the heat! I have seen enough to-night to justify me in
      insisting that your daughter and Launcelot Linzie shall meet no more
      between this and the day of my marriage.&rdquo; Sir Joseph attempted to speak.
      Turlington declined to give him the opportunity. &ldquo;Yes! yes! your opinion
      of Linzie isn&rsquo;t mine, I know. I saw you as thick as thieves together just
      now.&rdquo; Sir Joseph once more attempted to make himself heard. Wearied by
      Turlington&rsquo;s perpetual complaints of his daughter and his nephew, he was
      sufficiently irritated by this time to have reported what Launce had
      actually said to him if he had been allowed the chance. But Turlington
      persisted in going on. &ldquo;I cannot prevent Linzie from being received in
      this house, and at your sister&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I can keep him out of <i>my</i>
      house in the country, and to the country let us go. I propose a change in
      the arrangements. Have you any engagement for the Christmas holidays?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and fixed his eyes attentively on Sir Joseph. Sir Joseph,
      looking a little surprised, replied briefly that he had no engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; resumed Turlington, &ldquo;I invite you all to Somersetshire,
      and I propose that the marriage shall take place from my house, and not
      from yours. Do you refuse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is contrary to the usual course of proceeding in such cases, Richard,&rdquo;
       Sir Joseph began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you refuse?&rdquo; reiterated Turlington. &ldquo;I tell you plainly, I shall place
      a construction of my own upon your motive if you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Richard,&rdquo; said Sir Joseph, quietly, &ldquo;I accept.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turlington drew back a step in silence. Sir Joseph had turned the tables
      on him, and had taken <i>him</i> by surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will upset several plans, and be strongly objected to by the ladies,&rdquo;
       proceeded the old gentleman. &ldquo;But if nothing less will satisfy you, I say,
      Yes! I shall have occasion, when we meet to-morrow at Muswell Hill, to
      appeal to your indulgence under circumstances which may greatly astonish
      you. The least I can do, in the meantime, is to set an example of friendly
      sympathy and forbearance on my side. No more now, Richard. Hush! the
      music!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to make him explain himself further that night.
      Turlington was left to interpret Sir Joseph&rsquo;s mysterious communication
      with such doubtful aid to success as his own unassisted ingenuity might
      afford.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meeting of the next day at Muswell Hill had for its object&mdash;as
      Turlington had already been informed&mdash;the drawing of Natalie&rsquo;s
      marriage-settlement. Was the question of money at the bottom of Sir
      Joseph&rsquo;s contemplated appeal to his indulgence? He thought of his
      commercial position. The depression in the Levant trade still continued.
      Never had his business at any previous time required such constant
      attention, and repaid that attention with so little profit. The Bills of
      Lading had been already used by the firm, in the ordinary course of trade,
      to obtain possession of the goods. The duplicates in the hands of Bulpit
      Brothers were literally waste paper. Repayment of the loan of forty
      thousand pounds (with interest) was due in less than a month&rsquo;s time. There
      was his commercial position! Was it possible that money-loving Sir Joseph
      had any modification to propose in the matter of his daughter&rsquo;s dowry? The
      bare dread that it might be so struck him cold. He quitted the house&mdash;and
      forgot to wish Natalie goodnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Launce had left the evening party before him&mdash;and Launce
      also found matter for serious reflection presented to his mind before he
      slept that night. In other words, he found, on reaching his lodgings, a
      letter from his brother marked &ldquo;private.&rdquo; Had the inquiry into the secrets
      of Turlington&rsquo;s early life&mdash;now prolonged over some weeks&mdash;led
      to positive results at last? Launce eagerly opened the letter. It
      contained a Report and a Summary. He passed at once to the Summary, and
      read these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you only want moral evidence to satisfy your own mind, your end is
      gained. There is, morally, no doubt that Turlington and the sea-captain
      who cast the foreign sailor overboard to drown are on e and the same man.
      Legally, the matter is beset by difficulties, Turlington having destroyed
      all provable connection between his present self and his past life. There
      is only one chance for us. A sailor on board the ship (who was in his
      master&rsquo;s secrets) is supposed to be still living (under his master&rsquo;s
      protection). All the black deeds of Turlington&rsquo;s early life are known to
      this man. He can prove the facts, if we can find him, and make it worth
      his while to speak. Under what alias he is hidden we do not know. His own
      name is Thomas Wildfang. If we are to make the attempt to find him, not a
      moment is to be lost. The expenses may be serious. Let me know whether we
      are to go on, or whether enough has been done to attain the end you have
      in view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Enough had been done&mdash;not only to satisfy Launce, but to produce the
      right effect on Sir Joseph&rsquo;s mind if Sir Joseph proved obdurate when the
      secret of the marriage was revealed. Launce wrote a line directing the
      stoppage of the proceedings at the point which they had now reached. &ldquo;Here
      is a reason for her not marrying Turlington,&rdquo; he said to himself, as he
      placed the papers under lock and key. &ldquo;And if she doesn&rsquo;t marry
      Turlington,&rdquo; he added, with a lover&rsquo;s logic, &ldquo;why shouldn&rsquo;t she marry Me?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      EIGHTH SCENE.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The Library.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The next day Sir Joseph Graybrooke, Sir Joseph&rsquo;s lawyer, Mr. Dicas (highly
      respectable and immensely rich), and Richard Turlington were assembled in
      the library at Muswell Hill, to discuss the question of Natalie&rsquo;s marriage
      settlement.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the usual preliminary phrases had been exchanged, Sir Joseph showed
      some hesitation in openly approaching the question which the little party
      of three had met to debate. He avoided his lawyer&rsquo;s eye; and he looked at
      Turlington rather uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; he began at last, &ldquo;when I spoke to you about your marriage, on
      board the yacht, I said I would give my daughter&mdash;&rdquo; Either his
      courage or his breath failed him at that point. He was obliged to wait a
      moment before he could go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said I would give my daughter half my fortune on her marriage,&rdquo; he
      resumed. &ldquo;Forgive me, Richard. I can&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dicas, waiting for his instructions, laid down his pen and looked at
      Sir Joseph&rsquo;s son-in-law elect. What would Mr. Turlington say?
    </p>
    <p>
      He said nothing. Sitting opposite the window, he rose when Sir Joseph
      spoke, and placed himself at the other side of the table, with his back to
      the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My eyes are weak this morning,&rdquo; he said, in an unnaturally low tone of
      voice. &ldquo;The light hurts them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could find no more plausible excuse than that for concealing his face
      in shadow from the scrutiny of the two men on either side of him. The
      continuous moral irritation of his unhappy courtship&mdash;a courtship
      which had never advanced beyond the frigid familiarity of kissing
      Natalie&rsquo;s hand in the presence of others&mdash;had physically deteriorated
      him. Even <i>his</i> hardy nerves began to feel the long strain of
      suspicion that had been laid unremittingly on them for weeks past. His
      power of self-control&mdash;he knew it himself&mdash;was not to be relied
      on. He could hide his face: he could no longer command it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear what I said, Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard. Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Joseph proceeded, gathering confidence as he advanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half my fortune!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s parting with half my life; it&rsquo;s
      saying good-by forever to my dearest friend! My money has been such a
      comfort to me, Richard; such a pleasant occupation for my mind. I know no
      reading so interesting and so instructive as the reading of one&rsquo;s Banker&rsquo;s
      Book. To watch the outgoings on one side,&rdquo; said Sir Joseph, with a gentle
      and pathetic solemnity, &ldquo;and the incomings on the other&mdash;the sad
      lessening of the balance at one time, and the cheering and delightful
      growth of it at another&mdash;what absorbing reading! The best novel that
      ever was written isn&rsquo;t to be mentioned in a breath with it. I can not,
      Richard, I really can <i>not</i>, see my nice round balance shrink up to
      half the figure that I have been used to for a lifetime. It may be weak of
      me,&rdquo; proceeded Sir Joseph, evidently feeling that it was not weak of him
      at all, &ldquo;but we all have our tender place, and my Banker&rsquo;s Book is mine.
      Besides, it isn&rsquo;t as if you wanted it. If you wanted it, of course&mdash;but
      you don&rsquo;t want it. You are a rich man; you are marrying my dear Natalie
      for love, not for money. You and she and my grandchildren will have it all
      at my death. It <i>can</i> make no difference to you to wait a few years
      till the old man&rsquo;s chair at the fireside is empty. Will you say the fourth
      part, Richard, instead of the half? Twenty thousand,&rdquo; pleaded Sir Joseph,
      piteously. &ldquo;I can bear twenty thousand off. For God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t ask me
      for more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lips of the lawyer twisted themselves sourly into an ironical smile.
      He was quite as fond of his money as Sir Joseph. He ought to have felt for
      his client; but rich men have no sympathy with one another. Mr. Dicas
      openly despised Sir Joseph.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. The robin-redbreasts in the shrubbery outside must have
      had prodigious balances at their bankers; they hopped up on the
      window-sill so fearlessly; they looked in with so little respect at the
      two rich men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep me in suspense, Richard,&rdquo; proceeded Sir Joseph. &ldquo;Speak out. Is
      it yes or no?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turlington struck his hand excitedly on the table, and burst out on a
      sudden with the answer which had been so strangely delayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty thousand with all my heart!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;On this condition,
      Graybrooke, that every farthing of it is settled on Natalie, and on her
      children after her. Not a half-penny to me!&rdquo; he cried magnanimously, in
      his brassiest tones. &ldquo;Not a half-penny to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Let no man say the rich are heartless. Sir Joseph seized his son-in-law&rsquo;s
      hand in silence, and burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dicas, habitually a silent man, uttered the first two words that had
      escaped him since the business began. &ldquo;Highly creditable,&rdquo; he said, and
      took a note of his instructions on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that point the business of the settlement flowed smoothly on to its
      destined end. Sir Joseph explained his views at the fullest length, and
      the lawyer&rsquo;s pen kept pace with him. Turlington, remaining in his place at
      the table, restricted himself to a purely passive part in the proceedings.
      He answered briefly when it was absolutely necessary to speak, and he
      agreed with the two elders in everything. A man has no attention to place
      at the disposal of other people when he stands at a crisis in his life.
      Turlington stood at that crisis, at the trying moment when Sir Joseph&rsquo;s
      unexpected proposal pressed instantly for a reply. Two merciless
      alternatives confronted him. Either he must repay the borrowed forty
      thousand pounds on the day when repayment was due, or he must ask Bulpit
      Brothers to grant him an extension of time, and so inevitably provoke an
      examination into the fraudulent security deposited with the firm, which
      could end in but one way. His last, literally his last chance, after Sir
      Joseph had diminished the promised dowry by one half, was to adopt the
      high-minded tone which became his position, and to conceal the truth until
      he could reveal it to his father-in-law in the privileged character of
      Natalie&rsquo;s husband. &ldquo;I owe forty thousand pounds, sir, in a fortnight&rsquo;s
      time, and I have not got a farthing of my own. Pay for me, or you will see
      your son-in-law&rsquo;s name in the Bankrupt&rsquo;s List.&rdquo; For his daughter&rsquo;s sake&mdash;who
      could doubt it?&mdash;Sir Joseph would produce the money. The one thing
      needful was to be married in time. If either by accident or treachery Sir
      Joseph was led into deferring the appointed day, by so much as a fortnight
      only, the fatal &ldquo;call&rdquo; would come, and the firm of Pizzituti, Turlington
      &amp; Branca would appear in the Gazette.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he reasoned, standing on the brink of the terrible discovery which was
      soon to reveal to him that Natalie was the wife of another man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Turlington!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He started, and roused his attention to present things. Sir Joseph on one
      side, and the lawyer on the other, were both appealing to him, and both
      regarding him with looks of amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you done with the settlement?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Richard, we have done with it long since,&rdquo; replied Sir Joseph.
      &ldquo;Have you really not heard what I have been saying for the last quarter of
      an hour to good Mr. Dicas here? What <i>can</i> you have been thinking
      of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turlington did not attempt to answer the question. &ldquo;Am I interested,&rdquo; he
      asked, &ldquo;in what you have been saying to Mr. Dicas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall judge for yourself,&rdquo; answered Sir Joseph, mysteriously; &ldquo;I have
      been giving Mr. Dicas his instructions for making my Will. I wish the Will
      and the Marriage-Settlement to be executed at the same time. Read the
      instructions, Mr. Dicas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Joseph&rsquo;s contemplated Will proved to have two merits&mdash;it was
      simple and it was short. Excepting one or two trifling legacies to distant
      relatives, he had no one to think of (Miss Lavinia being already provided
      for) but his daughter and the children who might be born of her marriage.
      In its various provisions, made with these two main objects in view, the
      Will followed the precedents established in such cases. It differed in no
      important respect from the tens of thousands of other wills made under
      similar circumstances. Sir Joseph&rsquo;s motive in claiming special attention
      for it still remained unexplained, when Mr. Dicas reached the clause
      devoted to the appointment of executors and trustees; and announced that
      this portion of the document was left in blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Joseph Graybrooke, are you prepared to name the persons whom you
      appoint?&rdquo; asked the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Joseph rose, apparently for the purpose of giving special importance
      to the terms in which he answered his lawyer&rsquo;s question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I appoint,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as sole executor and trustee&mdash;Richard
      Turlington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was no easy matter to astonish Mr. Dicas. Sir Joseph&rsquo;s reply absolutely
      confounded him. He looked across the table at his client and delivered
      himself on this special occasion of as many as three words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you mad?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Joseph&rsquo;s healthy complexion slightly reddened. &ldquo;I never was in more
      complete possession of myself, Mr. Dicas, than at this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dicas was not to be silenced in that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you aware of what you do,&rdquo; persisted the lawyer, &ldquo;if you appoint Mr.
      Turlington as sole executor and trustee? You put it in the power of your
      daughter&rsquo;s husband, sir, to make away with every farthing of your money
      after your death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turlington had hitherto listened with an appearance of interest in the
      proceedings, which he assumed as an act of politeness. To his view, the
      future was limited to the date at which Bulpit Brothers had a right to
      claim the repayment of their loan. The Will was a matter of no earthly
      importance to him, by comparison with the infinitely superior interest of
      the Marriage. It was only when the lawyer&rsquo;s brutally plain language forced
      his attention to it that the question of his pecuniary interest in his
      father-in-law&rsquo;s death assumed its fit position in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>His</i> color rose; and <i>he</i> too showed that he was offended by
      what Mr. Dicas had just said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word, Richard! Let me speak for you as well as for myself,&rdquo; said
      Sir Joseph. &ldquo;For seven years past,&rdquo; he continued, turning to the lawyer,
      &ldquo;I have been accustomed to place the most unlimited trust in Richard
      Turlington. His disinterested advice has enabled me largely to increase my
      income, without placing a farthing of the principal in jeopardy. On more
      than one occasion, I have entreated him to make use of my money in his
      business. He has invariably refused to do so. Even his bitterest enemies,
      sir, have been obliged to acknowledge that my interests were safe when
      committed to his care. Am I to begin distrusting him, now that I am about
      to give him my daughter in marriage? Am I to leave it on record that I
      doubt him for the first time&mdash;when my Will is opened after my death?
      No! I can confide the management of the fortune which my child will
      inherit after me to no more competent or more honorable hands than the
      hands of the man who is to marry her. I maintain my appointment, Mr.
      Dicas! I persist in placing the whole responsibility under my Will in my
      son-in-law&rsquo;s care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turlington attempted to speak. The lawyer attempted to speak. Sir Joseph&mdash;with
      a certain simple dignity which had its effect on both of them&mdash;declined
      to hear a word on either side. &ldquo;No, Richard! as long as I am alive this is
      my business, not yours. No, Mr. Dicas! I understand that it is your
      business to protest professionally. You have protested. Fill in the blank
      space as I have told you. Or leave the instructions on the table, and I
      will send for the nearest solicitor to complete them in your place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those words placed the lawyer&rsquo;s position plainly before him. He had no
      choice but to do as he was bid, or to lose a good client. He did as he was
      bid, and grimly left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Joseph, with old-fashioned politeness, followed him as far as the
      hall. Returning to the library to say a few friendly words before finally
      dismissing the subject of the Will, he found himself seized by the arm,
      and dragged without ceremony, in Turlington&rsquo;s powerful grasp, to the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;what does this mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; cried the other, pointing through the window to a grassy walk in
      the grounds, bounded on either side by shrubberies, and situated at a
      little distance from the house. &ldquo;Who is that man?&mdash;quick! before we
      lose sight of him&mdash;the man crossing there from one shrubbery to the
      other?&rdquo; Sir Joseph failed to recognize the figure before it disappeared.
      Turlington whispered fiercely, close to his ear&mdash;&ldquo;Launcelot Linzie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In perfect good faith Sir Joseph declared that the man could not possibly
      have been Launce. Turlington&rsquo;s frenzy of jealous suspicion was not to be
      so easily calmed. He asked significantly for Natalie. She was reported to
      be walking in the grounds. &ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo; he said, with an oath&mdash;and
      hurried out into the grounds to discover the truth for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some little time elapsed before he came back to the house. He had
      discovered Natalie&mdash;alone. Not a sign of Launce had rewarded his
      search. For the hundredth time he had offended Natalie. For the hundredth
      time he was compelled to appeal to the indulgence of her father and her
      aunt. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t happen again,&rdquo; he said, sullenly penitent. &ldquo;You will find
      me quite another man when I have got you all at my house in the country.
      Mind!&rdquo; he burst out, with a furtive look, which expressed his inveterate
      distrust of Natalie and of every one about her. &ldquo;Mind! it&rsquo;s settled that
      you all come to me in Somersetshire, on Monday next.&rdquo; Sir Joseph answered
      rather dryly that it was settled. Turlington turned to leave the room&mdash;and
      suddenly came back. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s understood,&rdquo; he went on, addressing Miss
      Lavinia, &ldquo;that the seventh of next month is the date fixed for the
      marriage. Not a day later!&rdquo; Miss Lavinia replied, rather dryly on her
      side, &ldquo;Of course, Richard; not a day later.&rdquo; He muttered, &ldquo;All right&rdquo; and
      hurriedly left them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour afterward Natalie came in, looking a little confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he gone?&rdquo; she asked, whispering to her aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Relieved on this point, she made straight for the library&mdash;a room
      which she rarely entered at that or any other period of the day. Miss
      Lavinia followed her, curious to know what it meant. Natalie hurried to
      the window, and waved her handkerchief&mdash;evidently making a signal to
      some one outside. Miss Lavinia instantly joined her, and took her sharply
      by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible, Natalie?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Has Launcelot Linzie really been
      here, unknown to your father or to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the harm if he has?&rdquo; answered Natalie, with a sudden outbreak of
      temper. &ldquo;Am I never to see my cousin again, because Mr. Turlington happens
      to be jealous of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She suddenly turned away her head. The rich color flowed over her face and
      neck. Miss Lavinia, proceeding sternly with the administration of the
      necessary reproof, was silenced midway by a new change in her niece&rsquo;s
      variable temper. Natalie burst into tears. Satisfied with this appearance
      of sincere contrition, the old lady consented to overlook what had
      happened; and, for this occasion only, to keep her niece&rsquo;s secret. They
      would all be in Somersetshire, she remarked, before any more breaches of
      discipline could be committed. Richard had fortunately made no
      discoveries; and the matter might safely be trusted, all things
      considered, to rest where it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lavinia might possibly have taken a less hopeful view of the
      circumstances, if she had known that one of the men-servants at Muswell
      Hill was in Richard Turlington&rsquo;s pay, and that this servant had seen
      Launce leave the grounds by the back-garden gate.

    <h2>
      NINTH SCENE.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The Drawing-Room.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amelia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask him to sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus addressing one another in whispers, the three stepdaughters of Lady
      Winwood stood bewildered in their own drawing-room, helplessly confronting
      an object which appeared before them on the threshold of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The date was the 23d of December. The time was between two and three in
      the afternoon. The occasion was the return of the three sisters from the
      Committee meeting of the Sacred Concerts&rsquo; Society. And the object was
      Richard Turlington.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood hat in hand at the door, amazed by his reception. &ldquo;I have come up
      this morning from Somersetshire,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you heard? A matter of
      business at the office has forced me to leave my guests at my house in the
      country. I return to them to-morrow. When I say my guests, I mean the
      Graybrookes. Don&rsquo;t you know they are staying with me? Sir Joseph and Miss
      Lavinia and Natalie?&rdquo; On the utterance of Natalie&rsquo;s name, the sisters
      roused themselves. They turned about and regarded each other with looks of
      dismay. Turlington&rsquo;s patience began to fail him. &ldquo;Will you be so good as
      to tell me what all this means?&rdquo; he said, a little sharply. &ldquo;Miss Lavinia
      asked me to call here when she heard I was coming to town. I was to take
      charge of a pattern for a dress, which she said you would give me. You
      ought to have received a telegram explaining it all, hours since. Has the
      message not reached you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The leading spirit of the three sisters was Miss Amelia. She was the first
      who summoned presence of mind enough to give a plain answer to
      Turlington&rsquo;s plain question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We received the telegram this morning,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Something has happened
      since which has shocked and surprised us. We beg your pardon.&rdquo; She turned
      to one of her sisters. &ldquo;Sophia, the pattern is ready in the drawer of that
      table behind you. Give it to Mr. Turlington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sophia produced the packet. Before she handed it to the visitor, she
      looked at her sister. &ldquo;Ought we to let Mr. Turlington go,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;as
      if nothing had happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelia considered silently with herself. Dorothea, the third sister (who
      had not spoken yet), came forward with a suggestion. She proposed, before
      proceeding further, to inquire whether Lady Winwood was in the house. The
      idea was instantly adopted. Sophia rang the bell. Amelia put the questions
      when the servant appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Winwood had left the house for a drive immediately after luncheon.
      Lord Winwood&mdash;inquired for next&mdash;had accompanied her ladyship.
      No message had been left indicating the hour of their return.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sisters looked at Turlington, uncertain what to say or do next. Miss
      Amelia addressed him as soon as the servant had left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible for you to remain here until either my father or Lady
      Winwood return?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite impossible. Minutes are of importance to me to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you give us one of your minutes? We want to consider something which
      we may have to say to you before you go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turlington, wondering, took a chair. Miss Amelia put the case before her
      sisters from the sternly conscientious point of view, at the opposite end
      of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have not found out this abominable deception by any underhand means,&rdquo;
       she said. &ldquo;The discovery has been forced upon us, and we stand pledged to
      nobody to keep the secret. Knowing as we do how cruelly this gentleman has
      been used, it seems to me that we are bound in honor to open his eyes to
      the truth. If we remain silent we make ourselves Lady Winwood&rsquo;s
      accomplices. I, for one&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care what may come of it&mdash;refuse
      to do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her sisters agreed with her. The first chance their clever stepmother had
      given them of asserting their importance against hers was now in their
      hands. Their jealous hatred of Lady Winwood assumed the mask of Duty&mdash;duty
      toward an outraged and deceived fellow-creature. Could any earthly motive
      be purer than that? &ldquo;Tell him, Amelia!&rdquo; cried the two young ladies, with
      the headlong recklessness of the sex which only stops to think when the
      time for reflection has gone by.
    </p>
    <p>
      A vague sense of something wrong began to stir uneasily in Turlington&rsquo;s
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me hurry you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but if you really have anything to
      tell me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Amelia summoned her courage, and began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have something very dreadful to tell you,&rdquo; she said, interrupting him.
      &ldquo;You have been presented in this house, Mr. Turlington, as a gentleman
      engaged to marry Lady Winwood&rsquo;s cousin. Miss Natalie Graybrooke.&rdquo; She
      paused there&mdash;at the outset of the disclosure. A sudden change of
      expression passed over Turlington&rsquo;s face, which daunted her for the
      moment. &ldquo;We have hitherto understood,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;that you were to be
      married to that young lady early in next month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could say that one word. Looking at their pale faces, and their eager
      eyes, he could say no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care!&rdquo; whispered Dorothea, in her sister&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;Look at him,
      Amelia! Not too soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelia went on more carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have just returned from a musical meeting,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;One of the
      ladies there was an acquaintance, a former school-fellow of ours. She is
      the wife of the rector of St. Columb Major&mdash;a large church, far from
      this&mdash;at the East End of London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about the woman or the church,&rdquo; interposed Turlington,
      sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must beg you to wait a little. I can&rsquo;t tell you what I want to tell you
      unless I refer to the rector&rsquo;s wife. She knows Lady Winwood by name. And
      she heard of Lady Winwood recently under very strange circumstances&mdash;circumstances
      connected with a signature in one of the books of the church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turlington lost his self-control. &ldquo;You have got something against my
      Natalie,&rdquo; he burst out; &ldquo;I know it by your whispering, I see it in your
      looks! Say it at once in plain words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no trifling with him now. In plain words Amelia said it.
    </p>
    <p>
      * * * * * * * * *
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence in the room. They could hear the sound of passing
      footsteps in the street. He stood perfectly still on the spot where they
      had struck him dumb by the disclosure, supporting himself with his right
      hand laid on the head of a sofa near him. The sisters drew back
      horror-struck into the furthest corner of the room. His face turned them
      cold. Through the mute misery which it had expressed at first, there
      appeared, slowly forcing its way to view, a look of deadly vengeance which
      froze them to the soul. They whispered feverishly one to the other,
      without knowing what they were talking of, without hearing their own
      voices. One of them said, &ldquo;Ring the bell!&rdquo; Another said, &ldquo;Offer him
      something, he will faint.&rdquo; The third shuddered, and repeated, over and
      over again, &ldquo;Why did we do it? Why did we do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He silenced them on the instant by speaking on his side. He came on
      slowly, by a step at a time, with the big drops of agony falling slowly
      over his rugged face. He said, in a hoarse whisper, &ldquo;Write me down the
      name of the church&mdash;there.&rdquo; He held out his open pocketbook to Amelia
      while he spoke. She steadied herself, and wrote the address. She tried to
      say a word to soften him. The word died on her lips. There was a light in
      his eyes as they looked at her which transfigured his face to something
      superhuman and devilish. She turned away from him, shuddering.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put the book back in his pocket, and passed his handkerchief over his
      face. After a moment of indecision, he suddenly and swiftly stole out of
      the room, as if he was afraid of their calling somebody in, and stopping
      him. At the door he turned round for a moment, and said, &ldquo;You will hear
      how this ends. I wish you good-morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door closed on him. Left by themselves, they began to realize it. They
      thought of the consequences when his back was turned and it was too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Graybrookes! Now he knew it, what would become of the Graybrookes?
      What would he do when he got back? Even at ordinary times&mdash;when he
      was on his best behavior&mdash;he was a rough man. What would happen? Oh,
      good God! what would happen when he and Natalie next stood face to face?
      It was a lonely house&mdash;Natalie had told them about it&mdash;no
      neighbors near; nobody by to interfere but the weak old father and the
      maiden aunt. Something ought to be done. Some steps ought to be taken to
      warn them. Advice&mdash;who could give advice? Who was the first person
      who ought to be told of what had happened? Lady Winwood? No! even at that
      crisis the sisters still shrank from their stepmother&mdash;still hated
      her with the old hatred! Not a word to <i>her!</i> They owed no duty to <i>her!</i>
      Who else could they appeal to? To their father? Yes! There was the person
      to advise them. In the meanwhile, silence toward their stepmother&mdash;silence
      toward every one till their father came back!
    </p>
    <p>
      They waited and waited. One after another the precious hours, pregnant
      with the issues of life and death, followed each other on the dial. Lady
      Winwood returned alone. She had left her husband at the House of Lords.
      Dinner-time came, and brought with it a note from his lordship. There was
      a debate at the House. Lady Winwood and his daughters were not to wait
      dinner for him.

    <h2>
      TENTH SCENE.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Green Anchor Lane.
    </h3>
    <p>
      An hour later than the time at which he had been expected, Richard
      Turlington appeared at his office in the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      He met beforehand all the inquiries which the marked change in him must
      otherwise have provoked, by announcing that he was ill. Before he
      proceeded to business, he asked if anybody was waiting to see him. One of
      the servants from Muswell Hill was waiting with another parcel for Miss
      Lavinia, ordered by telegram from the country that morning. Turlington
      (after ascertaining the servant&rsquo;s name) received the man in his private
      room. He there heard, for the first time, that Launcelot Linzie had been
      lurking in the grounds (exactly as he had supposed) on the day when the
      lawyer took his instructions for the Settlement and the Will.
    </p>
    <p>
      In two hours more Turlington&rsquo;s work was completed. On leaving the office&mdash;as
      soon as he was out of sight of the door&mdash;he turned eastward, instead
      of taking the way that led to his own house in town. Pursuing his course,
      he entered the labyrinth of streets which led, in that quarter of East
      London, to the unsavory neighborhood of the river-side.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time his mind was made up. The forecast shadow of meditated crime
      traveled before him already, as he threaded his way among his fellow-men.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been to the vestry of St. Columb Major, and had satisfied himself
      that he was misled by no false report. There was the entry in the Marriage
      Register. The one unexplained mystery was the mystery of Launce&rsquo;s conduct
      in permitting his wife to return to her father&rsquo;s house. Utterly unable to
      account for this proceeding, Turlington could only accept facts as they
      were, and determine to make the most of his time, while the woman who had
      deceived him was still under his roof. A hideous expression crossed his
      face as he realized the idea that he had got her (unprotected by her
      husband) in his house. &ldquo;When Launcelot Linzie <i>does</i> come to claim
      her,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;he shall find I have been even with him.&rdquo; He
      looked at his watch. Was it possible to save the last train and get back
      that night? No&mdash;the last train had gone. Would she take advantage of
      his absence to escape? He had little fear of it. She would never have
      allowed her aunt to send him to Lord Winwood&rsquo;s house, if she had felt the
      slightest suspicion of his discovering the truth in that quarter.
      Returning by the first train the next morning, he might feel sure of
      getting back in time. Meanwhile he had the hours of the night before him.
      He could give his mind to the serious question that must be settled before
      he left London&mdash;the question of repaying the forty thousand pounds.
      There was but one way of getting the money now. Sir Joseph had executed
      his Will; Sir Joseph&rsquo;s death would leave his sole executor and trustee
      (the lawyer had said it!) master of his fortune. Turlington determined to
      be master of it in four-and-twenty hours&mdash;striking the blow, without
      risk to himself, by means of another hand. In the face of the
      probabilities, in the face of the facts, he had now firmly persuaded
      himself that Sir Joseph was privy to the fraud that had been practiced on
      him. The Marriage-Settlement, the Will, the presence of the family at his
      country house&mdash;all these he believed to be so many stratagems
      invented to keep him deceived until the last moment. The truth was in
      those words which he had overheard between Sir Joseph and Launce&mdash;and
      in Launce&rsquo;s presence (privately encouraged, no doubt) at Muswell Hill.
      &ldquo;Her father shall pay me for it doubly: with his purse and with his life.&rdquo;
       With that thought in his heart, Richard Turlington wound his way through
      the streets by the river-side, and stopped at a blind alley called Green
      Anchor Lane, infamous to this day as the chosen resort of the most
      abandoned wretches whom London can produce.
    </p>
    <p>
      The policeman at the corner cautioned him as he turned into the alley.
      &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t hurt <i>me!</i>&rdquo; he answered, and walked on to a public-house
      at the bottom of the lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord at the door silently recognized him, and led the way in. They
      crossed a room filled with sailors of all nations drinking; ascended a
      staircase at the back of the house, and stopped at the door of the room on
      the second floor. There the landlord spoke for the first time. &ldquo;He has
      outrun his allowance, sir, as usual. You will find him with hardly a rag
      on his back. I doubt if he will last much longer. He had another fit of
      the horrors last night, and the doctor thinks badly of him.&rdquo; With that
      introduction he opened the door, and Turlington entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the miserable bed lay a gray-headed old man of gigantic stature, with
      nothing on him but a ragged shirt and a pair of patched, filthy trousers.
      At the side of the bed, with a bottle of gin on the rickety table between
      them, sat two hideous leering, painted monsters, wearing the dress of
      women. The smell of opium was in the room, as well as the smell of
      spirits. At Turlington&rsquo;s appearance, the old man rose on the bed and
      welcomed him with greedy eyes and outstretched hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money, master!&rdquo; he called out hoarsely. &ldquo;A crown piece in advance, for
      the sake of old times!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turlington turned to the women without answering, purse in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His clothes are at the pawnbroker&rsquo;s, of course. How much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty shillings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring them here, and be quick about it. You will find it worth your while
      when you come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The women took the pawnbroker&rsquo;s tickets from the pockets of the man&rsquo;s
      trousers and hurried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turlington closed the door, and seated himself by the bedside. He laid his
      hand familiarly on the giant&rsquo;s mighty shoulder, looked him full in the
      face, and said, in a whisper,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thomas Wildfang!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man started, and drew his huge hairy hand across his eyes, as if in
      doubt whether he was waking or sleeping. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better than ten years,
      master, since you called me by my name. If I am Thomas Wildfang, what are
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your captain, once more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thomas Wildfang sat up on the side of the bed, and spoke his next words
      cautiously in Turlington&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another man in the way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The giant shook his bald, bestial head dolefully. &ldquo;Too late. I&rsquo;m past the
      job. Look here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held up his hand, and showed it trembling incessantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an old
      man,&rdquo; he said, and let his hand drop heavily again on the bed beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turlington looked at the door, and whispered back,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man is as old as you are. And the money is worth having.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of Thomas Wildfang fastened greedily on Turlington&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
      hear,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Softly, captain. Let&rsquo;s hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      * * * * * * * * *
    </p>
    <p>
      When the women came back with the clothes, Turlington had left the room.
      Their promised reward lay waiting for them on the table, and Thomas
      Wildfang was eager to dress himself and be gone. They could get but one
      answer from him to every question they put. He had business in hand, which
      was not to be delayed. They would see him again in a day or two, with
      money in his purse. With that assurance he took his cudgel from the corner
      of the room, and stalked out swiftly by the back door of the house into
      the night.

    <h2>
      ELEVENTH SCENE.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Outside the House
    </h3>
    <p>
      The evening was chilly, but not cold for the time of year. There was no
      moon. The stars were out, and the wind was quiet. Upon the whole, the
      inhabitants of the little Somersetshire village of Baxdale agreed that it
      was as fine a Christmas-eve as they could remember for some years past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward eight in the evening the one small street of the village was empty,
      except at that part of it which was occupied by the public-house. For the
      most part, people gathered round their firesides, with an eye to their
      suppers, and watched the process of cooking comfortably indoors. The old
      bare, gray church, situated at some little distance from the village,
      looked a lonelier object than usual in the dim starlight. The vicarage,
      nestling close under the shadow of the church-tower, threw no illumination
      of fire-light or candle-light on the dreary scene. The clergyman&rsquo;s
      shutters fitted well, and the clergyman&rsquo;s curtains were closely drawn. The
      one ray of light that cheered the wintry darkness streamed from the
      unguarded window of a lonely house, separated from the vicarage by the
      whole length of the church-yard. A man stood at the window, holding back
      the shutter, and looking out attentively over the dim void of the
      burial-ground. The man was Richard Turlington. The room in which he was
      watching was a room in his own house.
    </p>
    <p>
      A momentary spark of light flashed up, as from a kindled match, in the
      burial-ground. Turlington instantly left the empty room in which he had
      been watching. Passing down the back garden of the house, and crossing a
      narrow lane at the bottom of it, he opened a gate in a low stone wall
      beyond, and entered the church-yard. The shadowy figure of a man of great
      stature, lurking among the graves, advanced to meet him. Midway in the
      dark and lonely place the two stopped and consulted together in whispers.
      Turlington spoke first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you taken up your quarters at the public-house in the village?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you find your way, while the daylight lasted, to the deserted
      malt-house behind my orchard wall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now listen&mdash;we have no time to lose. Hide there, behind that
      monument. Before nine o&rsquo;clock to-night you will see me cross the
      churchyard, as far as this place, with the man you are to wait for. He is
      going to spend an hour with the vicar, at the house yonder. I shall stop
      short here, and say to him, &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t miss your way in the dark now&mdash;I
      will go back.&rsquo; When I am far enough away from him, I shall blow a call on
      my whistle. The moment you hear the call, follow the man, and drop him
      before he gets out of the church-yard. Have you got your cudgel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thomas Wildfang held up his cudgel. Turlington took him by the arm, and
      felt it suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have had an attack of the horrors already,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What does this
      trembling mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took a spirit-flask from his pocket as he spoke. Thomas Wildfang
      snatched it out of his hand, and emptied it at a draught. &ldquo;All right now,
      master,&rdquo; he said. Turlington felt his arm once more. It was steadier
      already. Wildfang brandished his cudgel, and struck a heavy blow with it
      on one of the turf mounds near them. &ldquo;Will that drop him, captain?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turlington went on with his instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rob him when you have dropped him. Take his money and his jewelry. I want
      to have the killing of him attributed to robbery as the motive. Make sure
      before you leave him that he is dead. Then go to the malt-house. There is
      no fear of your being seen; all the people will be indoors, keeping
      Christmas-eve. You will find a change of clothes hidden in the malt-house,
      and an old caldron full of quicklime. Destroy the clothes you have got on,
      and dress yourself in the other clothes that you find. Follow the
      cross-road, and when it brings you into the highroad, turn to the left; a
      four-mile walk will take you to the town of Harminster. Sleep there
      to-night, and travel to London by the train in the morning. The next day
      go to my office, see the head clerk, and say, &lsquo;I have come to sign my
      receipt.&rsquo; Sign it in your own name, and you will receive your hundred
      pounds. There are your instructions. Do you understand them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wildfang nodded his head in silent token that he understood, and
      disappeared again among the graves. Turlington went back to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had advanced midway across the garden, when he was startled by the
      sound of footsteps in the lane&mdash;at that part of it which skirted one
      of the corners of the house. Hastening forward, he placed himself behind a
      projection in the wall, so as to see the person pass across the stream of
      light from the uncovered window of the room that he had left. The stranger
      was walking rapidly. All Turlington could see as he crossed the field of
      light was, that his hat was pulled over his eyes, and that he had a thick
      beard and mustache. Describing the man to the servant on entering the
      house, he was informed that a stranger with a large beard had been seen
      about the neighborhood for some days past. The account he had given of
      himself stated that he was a surveyor, engaged in taking measurements for
      a new map of that part of the country, shortly to be published.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guilty mind of Turlington was far from feeling satisfied with the
      meager description of the stranger thus rendered. He could not be engaged
      in surveying in the dark. What could he want in the desolate neighborhood
      of the house and church-yard at that time of night?
    </p>
    <p>
      The man wanted&mdash;what the man found a little lower down the lane,
      hidden in a dismantled part of the church-yard wall&mdash;a letter from a
      young lady. Read by the light of the pocket-lantern which he carried with
      him, the letter first congratulated this person on the complete success of
      his disguise&mdash;and then promised that the writer would be ready at her
      bedroom window for flight the next morning, before the house was astir.
      The signature was &ldquo;Natalie,&rdquo; and the person addressed was &ldquo;Dearest
      Launce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile, Turlington barred the window shutters of the room, and
      looked at his watch. It wanted only a quarter to nine o&rsquo;clock. He took his
      dog-whistle from the chimney-piece, and turned his steps at once in the
      direction of the drawing-room, in which his guests were passing the
      evening.

    <h2>
      TWELFTH SCENE.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Inside the House.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The scene in the drawing-room represented the ideal of domestic comfort.
      The fire of wood and coal mixed burned brightly; the lamps shed a soft
      glow of light; the solid shutters and the thick red curtains kept the cold
      night air on the outer side of two long windows, which opened on the back
      garden. Snug arm-chairs were placed in every part of the room. In one of
      them Sir Joseph reclined, fast asleep; in another, Miss Lavinia sat
      knitting; a third chair, apart from the rest, near a round table in one
      corner of the room, was occupied by Natalie. Her head was resting on her
      hand, an unread book lay open on her lap. She looked pale and harassed;
      anxiety and suspense had worn her down to the shadow of her former self.
      On entering the room, Turlington purposely closed the door with a bang.
      Natalie started. Miss Lavinia looked up reproachfully. The object was
      achieved&mdash;Sir Joseph was roused from his sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are going to the vicar&rsquo;s to-night. Graybrooke,&rdquo; said Turlington,
      &ldquo;it&rsquo;s time you were off, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Joseph rubbed his eyes, and looked at the clock on the mantel-piece.
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, Richard,&rdquo; he answered, drowsily, &ldquo;I suppose I must go. Where is
      my hat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His sister and his daughter both joined in trying to persuade him to send
      an excuse instead of groping his way to the vicarage in the dark. Sir
      Joseph hesitated, as usual. He and the vicar had run up a sudden
      friendship, on the strength of their common enthusiasm for the
      old-fashioned game of backgammon. Victorious over his opponent on the
      previous evening at Turlington&rsquo;s house, Sir Joseph had promised to pass
      that evening at the vicarage, and give the vicar his revenge. Observing
      his indecision, Turlington cunningly irritated him by affecting to believe
      that he was really unwilling to venture out in the dark. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you
      safe across the churchyard,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and the vicar&rsquo;s servant will see
      you safe back.&rdquo; The tone in which he spoke instantly roused Sir Joseph. &ldquo;I
      am not in my second childhood yet, Richard,&rdquo; he replied, testily. &ldquo;I can
      find my way by myself.&rdquo; He kissed his daughter on the forehead. &ldquo;No fear,
      Natalie. I shall be back in time for the mulled claret. No, Richard, I
      won&rsquo;t trouble you.&rdquo; He kissed his hand to his sister and went out into the
      hall for his hat: Turlington following him with a rough apology, and
      asking as a favor to be permitted to accompany him part of the way only.
      The ladies, left behind in the drawing-room, heard the apology accepted by
      kind-hearted Sir Joseph. The two went out together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you noticed Richard since his return?&rdquo; asked Miss Lavinia. &ldquo;I fancy
      he must have heard bad news in London. He looks as if he had something on
      his mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t remarked it, aunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the time, no more was said. Miss Lavinia went monotonously on with her
      knitting. Natalie pursued her own anxious thoughts over the unread pages
      of the book in her lap. Suddenly the deep silence out of doors and in was
      broken by a shrill whistle, sounding from the direction of the
      church-yard. Natalie started with a faint cry of alarm. Miss Lavinia
      looked up from her knitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child, your nerves must be sadly out of order. What is there to
      be frightened at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not very well, aunt. It is so still here at night, the slightest
      noises startle me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was another interval of silence. It was past nine o&rsquo;clock when they
      heard the back door opened and closed again. Turlington came hurriedly
      into the drawing-room, as if he had some reason for wishing to rejoin the
      ladies as soon as possible. To the surprise of both of them, he sat down
      abruptly in the corner, with his face to the wall, and took up the
      newspaper, without casting a look at them or uttering a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Joseph safe at the vicarage?&rdquo; asked Miss Lavinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right.&rdquo; He gave the answer in a short, surly tone, still without
      looking round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lavinia tried him again. &ldquo;Did you hear a whistle while you were out?
      It quite startled Natalie in the stillness of this place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned half-way round. &ldquo;My shepherd, I suppose,&rdquo; he said after a pause&mdash;&ldquo;whistling
      for his dog.&rdquo; He turned back again and immersed himself in his newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lavinia beckoned to her niece and pointed significantly to
      Turlington. After one reluctant look at him, Natalie laid her head wearily
      on her aunt&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Sleepy, my dear?&rdquo; whispered the old lady.
      &ldquo;Uneasy, aunt&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know why,&rdquo; Natalie whispered back. &ldquo;I would
      give the world to be in London, and to hear the carriages going by, and
      the people talking in the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turlington suddenly dropped his newspaper. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the secret between you
      two?&rdquo; he called out roughly. &ldquo;What are you whispering about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We wish not to disturb you over your reading, that is all,&rdquo; said Miss
      Lavinia, coldly. &ldquo;Has anything happened to vex you, Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil makes you think that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old lady was offended, and showed it by saying nothing more. Natalie
      nestled closer to her aunt. One after another the clock ticked off the
      minutes with painful distinctness in the stillness of the room. Turlington
      suddenly threw aside the newspaper and left his corner. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be good
      friends!&rdquo; he burst out, with a clumsy assumption of gayety. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t
      keeping Christmas-eve. Let&rsquo;s talk and be sociable. Dearest Natalie!&rdquo; He
      threw his arm roughly round Natalie, and drew her by main force away from
      her aunt. She turned deadly pale, and struggled to release herself. &ldquo;I am
      suffering&mdash;I am ill&mdash;let me go!&rdquo; He was deaf to her entreaties.
      &ldquo;What! your husband that is to be, treated in this way? Mustn&rsquo;t I have a
      kiss?&mdash;I will!&rdquo; He held her closer with one hand, and, seizing her
      head with the other, tried to turn her lips to him. She resisted with the
      inbred nervous strength which the weakest woman living has in reserve when
      she is outraged. Half indignant, half terrified, at Turlington&rsquo;s
      roughness, Miss Lavinia rose to interfere. In a moment more he would have
      had two women to overpower instead of one, when a noise outside the window
      suddenly suspended the ignoble struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sound of footsteps on the gravel-walk which ran between the
      house wall and the garden lawn. It was followed by a tap&mdash;a single
      faint tap, no more&mdash;on one of the panes of glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all three stood still. For a moment more nothing was audible. Then
      there was a heavy shock, as of something falling outside. Then a groan,
      then another interval of silence&mdash;a long silence, interrupted no
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turlington&rsquo;s arm dropped from Natalie. She drew back to her aunt. Looking
      at him instinctively, in the natural expectation that he would take the
      lead in penetrating the mystery of what had happened outside the window,
      the two women were thunderstruck to see that he was, to all appearance,
      even more startled and more helpless than they were. &ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; said Miss
      Lavinia, pointing to the window, &ldquo;there is something wrong out there. See
      what it is.&rdquo; He stood motionless, as if he had not heard her, his eyes
      fixed on the window, his face livid with terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence outside was broken once more; this time by a call for help.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cry of horror burst from Natalie. The voice outside&mdash;rising wildly,
      then suddenly dying away again&mdash;was not entirely strange to <i>her</i>
      ears. She tore aside the curtain. With voice and hand she roused her aunt
      to help her. The two lifted the heavy bar from its socket; they opened the
      shutters and the window. The cheerful light of the room flowed out over
      the body of a prostrate man, lying on his face. They turned the man over.
      Natalie lifted his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father!
    </p>
    <p>
      His face was bedabbled with blood. A wound, a frightful wound, was visible
      on the side of his bare head, high above the ear. He looked at her, his
      eyes recognized her, before he fainted again in her arms. His hands and
      his clothes were covered with earth stains. He must have traversed some
      distance; in that dreadful condition he must have faltered and fallen more
      than once before he reached the house. His sister wiped the blood from his
      face. His daughter called on him frantically to forgive her before he died&mdash;the
      harmless, gentle, kind-hearted father, who had never said a hard word to
      her! The father whom she had deceived!
    </p>
    <p>
      The terrified servants hurried into the room. Their appearance roused
      their master from the extraordinary stupor that had seized him. He was at
      the window before the footman could get there. The two lifted Sir Joseph
      into the room, and laid him on the sofa. Natalie knelt by him, supporting
      his head. Miss Lavinia stanched the flowing blood with her handkerchief.
      The women-servants brought linen and cold water. The man hurried away for
      the doctor, who lived on the other side of the village. Left alone again
      with Turlington, Natalie noticed that his eyes were fixed in immovable
      scrutiny on her father&rsquo;s head. He never said a word. He looked, looked,
      looked at the wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor arrived. Before either the daughter or the sister of the
      injured man could put the question, Turlington put it&mdash;&ldquo;Will he live
      or die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor&rsquo;s careful finger probed the wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make your minds easy. A little lower down, or in front, the blow might
      have been serious. As it is, there is no harm done. Keep him quiet, and he
      will be all right again in two or three days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hearing those welcome words, Natalie and her aunt sank on their knees in
      silent gratitude. After dressing the wound, the doctor looked round for
      the master of the house. Turlington, who had been so breathlessly eager
      but a few minutes since, seemed to have lost all interest in the case now.
      He stood apart, at the window, looking out toward the church-yard,
      thinking. The questions which it was the doctor&rsquo;s duty to ask were
      answered by the ladies. The servants assisted in examining the injured
      man&rsquo;s clothes: they discovered that his watch and purse were both missing.
      When it became necessary to carry him upstairs, it was the footman who
      assisted the doctor. The foot man&rsquo;s master, without a word of explanation,
      walked out bare headed into the back garden, on the search, as the doctor
      and the servants supposed, for some trace of the robber who had attempted
      Sir Joseph&rsquo;s life.
    </p>
    <p>
      His absence was hardly noticed at the time. The difficulty of conveying
      the wounded man to his room absorbed the attention of all the persons
      present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Joseph partially recovered his senses while they were taking him up
      the steep and narrow stairs. Carefully as they carried the patient, the
      motion wrung a groan from him before they reached the top. The bedroom
      corridor, in the rambling, irregularly built house rose and fell on
      different levels. At the door of the first bedchamber the doctor asked a
      little anxiously if that was the room. No; there were three more stairs to
      go down, and a corner to turn, before they could reach it. The first room
      was Natalie&rsquo;s. She instantly offered it for her father&rsquo;s use. The doctor
      (seeing that it was the airiest as well as the nearest room) accepted the
      proposal. Sir Joseph had been laid comfortably in his daughter&rsquo;s bed; the
      doctor had just left them, with renewed assurances that they need feel no
      anxiety, when they heard a heavy step below stairs. Turlington had
      re-entered the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      (He had been looking, as they had supposed, for the ruffian who had
      attacked Sir Joseph; with a motive, however, for the search at which it
      was impossible for other persons to guess. His own safety was now bound up
      in the safety of Thomas Wildfang. As soon as he was out of sight in the
      darkness, he made straight for the malt-house. The change of clothes was
      there untouched; not a trace of his accomplice was to be seen. Where else
      to look for him it was impossible to tell. Turlington had no alternative
      but to go back to the house, and ascertain if suspicion had been aroused
      in his absence.)
    </p>
    <p>
      He had only to ascend the stairs, and to see, through the open door, that
      Sir Joseph had been placed in his daughter&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; he asked, roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before it was possible to answer him the footman appeared with a message.
      The doctor had come back to the door to say that he would take on himself
      the necessary duty of informing the constable of what had happened, on his
      return to the village. Turlington started and changed color. If Wildfang
      was found by others, and questioned in his employer&rsquo;s absence, serious
      consequences might follow. &ldquo;The constable is my business,&rdquo; said
      Turlington, hurriedly descending the stairs; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with the doctor.&rdquo;
       They heard him open the door below, then close it again (as if some sudden
      thought had struck him), and call to the footman. The house was badly
      provided with servants&rsquo; bedrooms. The women-servants only slept indoors.
      The footman occupied a room over the stables. Natalie and her aunt heard
      Turlington dismiss the man for the night, an hour earlier than usual at
      least. His next proceeding was stranger still. Looking cautiously over the
      stairs, Natalie saw him lock all the doors on the ground-floor and take
      out the keys. When he went away, she heard him lock the front door behind
      him. Incredible as it seemed, there could be no doubt of the fact&mdash;the
      inmates of the house were imprisoned till he came back. What did it mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      (It meant that Turlington&rsquo;s vengeance still remained to be wreaked on the
      woman who had deceived him. It meant that Sir Joseph&rsquo;s life still stood
      between the man who had compassed his death and the money which the man
      was resolved to have. It meant that Richard Turlington was driven to bay,
      and that the horror and the peril of the night were not at an end yet.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Natalie and her aunt looked at each other across the bed on which Sir
      Joseph lay. He had fallen into a kind of doze; no enlightenment could come
      to them from <i>him</i>. They could only ask each other, with beating
      hearts and baffled minds, what Richard&rsquo;s conduct meant&mdash;they could
      only feel instinctively that some dreadful discovery was hanging over
      them. The aunt was the calmer of the two&mdash;there was no secret
      weighing heavily on <i>her</i> conscience. <i>She</i> could feel the
      consolations of religion. &ldquo;Our dear one is spared to us, my love,&rdquo; said
      the old lady, gently. &ldquo;God has been good to us. We are in his hands. If we
      know that, we know enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke there was a loud ring at the doorbell. The women-servants
      crowded into the bedroom in alarm. Strong in numbers, and encouraged by
      Natalie&mdash;who roused herself and led the way&mdash;they confronted the
      risk of opening the window and of venturing out on the balcony which
      extended along that side of the house. A man was dimly visible below. He
      called to them in thick, unsteady accents. The servants recognized him: he
      was the telegraphic messenger from the railway. They went down to speak to
      him&mdash;and returned with a telegram which had been pushed in under the
      door. The distance from the station was considerable; the messenger had
      been &ldquo;keeping Christmas&rdquo; in more than one beer-shop on his way to the
      house; and the delivery of the telegram had been delayed for some hours.
      It was addressed to Natalie. She opened it&mdash;looked at it&mdash;dropped
      it&mdash;and stood speechless; her lips parted in horror, her eyes staring
      vacantly straight before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lavinia took the telegram from the floor, and read these lines:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Winwood, Hertford Street, London. To Natalie Graybrooke, Church
      Meadows, Baxdale, Somersetshire. Dreadful news. R. T. has discovered your
      marriage to Launce. The truth has been kept from me till to-day (24th).
      Instant flight with your husband is your only chance. I would have
      communicated with Launce, but I do not know his address. You will receive
      this, I hope and believe, before R. T. can return to Somersetshire.
      Telegraph back, I entreat you, to say that you are safe. I shall follow my
      message if I do not hear from you in reasonable time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lavinia lifted her gray head, and looked at her niece. &ldquo;Is this
      true?&rdquo; she said&mdash;and pointed to the venerable face laid back, white,
      on the white pillow of the bed. Natalie sank forward as her eyes met the
      eyes of her aunt. Miss Lavinia saved her from falling insensible on the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      * * * * * * * * *
    </p>
    <p>
      The confession had been made. The words of penitence and the words of
      pardon had been spoken. The peaceful face of the father still lay hushed
      in rest. One by one the minutes succeeded each other uneventfully in the
      deep tranquillity of the night. It was almost a relief when the silence
      was disturbed once more by another sound outside the house. A pebble was
      thrown up at the window, and a voice called out cautiously, &ldquo;Miss
      Lavinia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They recognized the voice of the man-servant, and at once opened the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had something to say to the ladies in private. How could he say it? A
      domestic circumstance which had been marked by Launce, as favorable to the
      contemplated elopement, was now noticed by the servant as lending itself
      readily to effecting the necessary communication with the ladies. The lock
      of the gardener&rsquo;s tool-house (in the shrubbery close by) was under repair;
      and the gardener&rsquo;s ladder was accessible to any one who wanted it. At the
      short height of the balcony from the ground, the ladder was more than long
      enough for the purpose required. In a few minutes the servant had mounted
      to the balcony, and could speak to Natalie and her aunt at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t rest quiet,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off on the sly to see what&rsquo;s
      going on down in the village. It&rsquo;s hard on ladies like you to be locked in
      here. Is there anything I can do for either of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Natalie took up Lady Winwood&rsquo;s telegram. &ldquo;Launce ought to see this,&rdquo; she
      said to her aunt. &ldquo;He will be here at daybreak,&rdquo; she added, in a whisper,
      &ldquo;if I don&rsquo;t tell him what has happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lavinia turned pale. &ldquo;If he and Richard meet&mdash;&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;Tell
      him!&rdquo; she added, hurriedly&mdash;&ldquo;tell him before it is too late!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Natalie wrote a few lines (addressed to Launce in his assumed name at his
      lodgings in the village) inclosing Lady Winwood&rsquo;s telegram, and entreating
      him to do nothing rash. When the servant had disappeared with the letter,
      there was one hope in her mind and in her aunt&rsquo;s mind, which each was
      ashamed to acknowledge to the other&mdash;the hope that Launce would face
      the very danger that they dreaded for him, and come to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not been long alone again, when Sir Joseph drowsily opened his
      eyes and asked what they were doing in his room. They told him gently that
      he was ill. He put his hand up to his head, and said they were right, and
      so dropped off again into slumber. Worn out by the emotions through which
      they had passed, the two women silently waited for the march of events.
      The same stupor of resignation possessed them both. They had secured the
      door and the window. They had prayed together. They had kissed the quiet
      face on the pillow. They had said to each other, &ldquo;We will live with him or
      die with him as God pleases.&rdquo; Miss Lavinia sat by the bedside. Natalie was
      on a stool at her feet&mdash;with her eyes closed, and her head on her
      aunt&rsquo;s knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time went on. The clock in the hall had struck&mdash;ten or eleven, they
      were not sure which&mdash;when they heard the signal which warned them of
      the servant&rsquo;s return from the village. He brought news, and more than
      news; he brought a letter from Launce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Natalie read these lines:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be with you, dearest, almost as soon as you receive this. The
      bearer will tell you what has happened in the village&mdash;your note
      throws a new light on it all. I only remain behind to go to the vicar (who
      is also the magistrate here), and declare myself your husband. All
      disguise must be at an end now. My place is with you and yours. It is even
      worse than your worst fears. Turlington was at the bottom of the attack on
      your father. Judge if you have not need of your husband&rsquo;s protection after
      that!&mdash;L.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Natalie handed the letter to her aunt, and pointed to the sentence which
      asserted Turlington&rsquo;s guilty knowledge of the attempt on Sir Joseph&rsquo;s
      life. In silent horror the two women looked at each other, recalling what
      had happened earlier in the evening, and understanding it now. The servant
      roused them to a sense of present things, by entering on the narrative of
      his discoveries in the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place was all astir when he reached it. An old man&mdash;a stranger in
      Baxdale&mdash;had been found lying in the road, close to the church, in a
      fit; and the person who had discovered him had been no other than Launce
      himself. He had, literally, stumbled over the body of Thomas Wildfang in
      the dark, on his way back to his lodgings in the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gentleman gave the alarm, miss,&rdquo; said the servant, describing the
      event, as it had been related to him, &ldquo;and the man&mdash;a huge, big old
      man&mdash;was carried to the inn. The landlord identified him; he had
      taken lodgings at the inn that day, and the constable found valuable
      property on him&mdash;a purse of money and a gold watch and chain. There
      was nothing to show who the money and the watch belonged to. It was only
      when my master and the doctor got to the inn that it was known whom he had
      robbed and tried to murder. All he let out in his wanderings before they
      came was that some person had set him on to do it. He called the person
      &lsquo;Captain,&rsquo; and sometimes &lsquo;Captain Goward.&rsquo; It was thought&mdash;if you
      could trust the ravings of a madman&mdash;that the fit took him while he
      was putting his hand on Sir Joseph&rsquo;s heart to feel if it had stopped
      beating. A sort of vision (as I understand it) must have overpowered him
      at the moment. They tell me he raved about the sea bursting into the
      church yard, and a drowning sailor floating by on a hen-coop; a sailor who
      dragged him down to hell by the hair of his head, and such like horrible
      nonsense, miss. He was still screeching, at the worst of the fit, when my
      master and the doctor came into the room. At sight of one or other of them&mdash;it
      is thought of Mr. Turlington, seeing that he came first&mdash;he held his
      peace on a sudden, and then fell back in convulsions in the arms of the
      men who were holding him. The doctor gave it a learned name, signifying
      drink-madness, and said the case was hopeless. However, he ordered the
      room to be cleared of the crowd to see what he could do. My master was
      reported to be still with the doctor, waiting to see whether the man lived
      or died, when I left the village, miss, with the gentleman&rsquo;s answer to
      your note. I didn&rsquo;t dare stay to hear how it ended, for fear of Mr.
      Turlington&rsquo;s finding me out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having reached the end of his narrative, the man looked round restlessly
      toward the window. It was impossible to say when his master might not
      return, and it might be as much as his life was worth to be caught in the
      house after he had been locked out of it. He begged permission to open the
      window, and make his escape back to the stables while there was still
      time. As he unbarred the shutter they were startled by a voice hailing
      them from below. It was Launce&rsquo;s voice calling to Natalie. The servant
      disappeared, and Natalie was in Launce&rsquo;s arms before she could breathe
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      For one delicious moment she let her head lie on his breast; then she
      suddenly pushed him away from her. &ldquo;Why do you come here? He will kill you
      if he finds you in the house. Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Launce knew even less of Turlington&rsquo;s movements than the servant.
      &ldquo;Wherever he is, thank God, I am here before him!&rdquo; That was all the answer
      he could give.
    </p>
    <p>
      Natalie and her aunt heard him in silent dismay. Sir Joseph woke, and
      recognized Launce before a word more could be said. &ldquo;Ah, my dear boy!&rdquo; he
      murmured, faintly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pleasant to see you again. How do you come here?&rdquo;
       He was quite satisfied with the first excuse that suggested itself. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
      talk about it to-morrow,&rdquo; he said, and composed himself to rest again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Natalie made a second attempt to persuade Launce to leave the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what may have happened,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He may have followed
      you on your way here. He may have purposely let you enter his house. Leave
      us while you have the chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lavinia added her persuasions. They were useless. Launce quietly
      closed the heavy window-shutters, lined with iron, and put up the bar.
      Natalie wrung her hands in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been to the magistrate?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Tell us, at least, are you
      here by his advice? Is he coming to help us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Launce hesitated. If he had told the truth, he must have acknowledged that
      he was there in direct opposition to the magistrate&rsquo;s advice. He answered
      evasively, &ldquo;If the vicar doesn&rsquo;t come, the doctor will. I have told him
      Sir Joseph must be moved. Cheer up, Natalie! The doctor will be here as
      soon as Turlington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the name passed his lips&mdash;without a sound outside to prepare them
      for what was coming&mdash;the voice of Turlington himself suddenly
      penetrated into the room, speaking close behind the window, on the outer
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have broken into my house in the night,&rdquo; said the voice. &ldquo;And you
      don&rsquo;t escape <i>this</i> way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lavinia sank on her knees. Natalie flew to her father. His eyes were
      wide open in terror; he moaned, feebly recognizing the voice. The next
      sound that was heard was the sound made by the removal of the ladder from
      the balcony. Turlington, having descended by it, had taken it away.
      Natalie had but too accurately guessed what would happen. The death of the
      villain&rsquo;s accomplice had freed him from all apprehension in that quarter.
      He had deliberately dogged Launce&rsquo;s steps, and had deliberately allowed
      him to put himself in the wrong by effecting a secret entrance into the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an interval&mdash;a horrible interval&mdash;and then they heard
      the front door opened. Without stopping (judging by the absence of sound)
      to close it again, Turlington rapidly ascended the stairs and tried the
      locked door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come out, and give yourself up!&rdquo; he called through the door. &ldquo;I have got
      my revolver with me, and I have a right to fire on a man who has broken
      into my house. If the door isn&rsquo;t opened before I count three, your blood
      be on your own head. One!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Launce was armed with nothing but his stick. He advanced, without an
      instant&rsquo;s hesitation, to give himself up. Natalie threw her arms round him
      and clasped him fast before he could reach the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two!&rdquo; cried the voice outside, as Launce struggled to force her from him.
      At the same moment his eye turned toward the bed. It was exactly opposite
      the door&mdash;it was straight in the line of fire! Sir Joseph&rsquo; s life (as
      Turlington had deliberately calculated) was actually in greater danger
      than Launce&rsquo;s life. He tore himself free, rushed to the bed, and took the
      old man in his arms to lift him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crash of the report sounded. The bullet came through the door, grazed
      Launce&rsquo;s left arm, and buried itself in the pillow, at the very place on
      which Sir Joseph&rsquo;s head had rested the moment before. Launce had saved his
      father-in-law&rsquo;s life. Turlington had fired his first shot for the money,
      and had not got it yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were safe in the corner of the room, on the same side as the door&mdash;Sir
      Joseph, helpless as a child, in Launce&rsquo;s arms; the women pale, but
      admirably calm. They were safe for the moment, when the second bullet
      (fired at an angle) tore its way through the wall on their right hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear you,&rdquo; cried the voice of the miscreant on the other side of the
      door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you yet&mdash;through the wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. They heard his hand sounding the wall, to find out
      where there was solid wood in the material of which it was built, and
      where there was plaster only. At that dreadful moment Launce&rsquo;s composure
      never left him. He laid Sir Joseph softly on the floor, and signed to
      Natalie and her aunt to lie down by him in silence. Their lives depended
      now on neither their voices nor their movements telling the murderer where
      to fire. He chose his place. The barrel of the revolver grated as he laid
      it against the wall. He touched the hair trigger. A faint <i>click</i> was
      the only sound that followed. The third barrel had missed fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      They heard him ask himself, with an oath, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with it now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was he examining the weapon?
    </p>
    <p>
      Before they could ask themselves the question, the report of the exploding
      charge burst on their ears. It was instantly followed by a heavy fall.
      They looked at the opposite wall of the room. No sign of a bullet there or
      anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Launce signed to them not to move yet. They waited, and listened. Nothing
      stirred on the landing outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there was a disturbance of the silence in the lower regions&mdash;a
      clamor of many voices at the open house door. Had the firing of the
      revolver been heard at the vicarage? Yes! They recognized the vicar&rsquo;s
      voice among the others. A moment more, and they heard a general
      exclamation of horror on the stairs. Launce opened the door of the room.
      He instantly closed it again before Natalie could follow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dead body of Turlington lay on the landing outside. The charge in the
      fourth barrel of the revolver had exploded while he was looking at it. The
      bullet had entered his mouth and killed him on the spot.

      &ldquo;We are requested to give the fullest contradiction to unfavorable rumors
      lately in circulation respecting the firm of Pizzituti, Turlington, and
      Branca. Some temporary derangement in the machinery of the business was
      undoubtedly produced in consequence of the sudden death of the lamented
      managing partner, Mr. Turlington, by the accidental discharge of a
      revolver which he was examining. Whatever temporary obstacles may have
      existed are now overcome. We are informed, on good authority, that the
      well-known house of Messrs. Bulpit Brothers has an interest in the
      business, and will carry it on until further notice.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
